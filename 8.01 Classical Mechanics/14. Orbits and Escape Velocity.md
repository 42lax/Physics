## Escape Velocity

If you are standing somewhere on Earth...

And let's assume for simplicity that there's no atmosphere that could interfere with us, and I want to give you one huge kick, an enormous speed, so that you never, ever come back to Earth, that you escape the gravitational attraction of the Earth.

![Escape from the Earth][1]

__What should that speed be?__ 

Well, when you're standing here and you have that speed, your mechanical energy--

![\mathrm{ME} = \frac{1}{2} mv_{escape}^2 -\frac{mM_{\bigoplus}G}{R_{\bigoplus}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BME%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20mv_%7Bescape%7D%5E2%20-%5Cfrac%7BmM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7BR_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7D%7D)

Mechanical energy is conserved, because gravity is a conservative force.

So no matter where you are on your way to infinity, 

if you are at some distance r, that mechanical energy is the same.

And so at infinity, when you get there--

potential energy at infinity is zero--

and if I get you to infinity with zero kinetic energy--

that would be the minimum amount of energy that I would require to get you to infinity and to have you escape the gravitational pull of the Earth.

If I give you a higher speed, well, then, you end up at infinity with a little bit net kinetic energy, so the most efficient way that I can do that is to make this also zero, so you reach infinity at zero speed.

And so we find

![\frac{1}{2} mv_{escape}^2 = \frac{mM_{\bigoplus}G}{R_{\bigoplus}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20mv_%7Bescape%7D%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BmM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7BR_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7D%7D)

and I find that 

![v_{escape}^2 = \sqrt{\frac{2M_{\bigoplus}G}{R_{\bigoplus}}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_%7Bescape%7D%5E2%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B2M_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7BR_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7D%7D%7D)

If you substitute in here the mass of the Earth and the radius of the Earth, then you will find that the escape velocity for the Earth is about 11.2 km/s.

If the total energy when you leave the Earth is equal to or larger than zero, we have __unbound orbit__--

If the total energy when you leave the Earth is negative, then you will never escape the gravitational pull of the Earth, and you will be in what we call a __bound orbit__.

## Circular Orbits

![Circular orbit][2]

Since the centripetal force is necessary to make it go around in a circle--and is given by the gravitational force, we have

![m\frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{mM_{\bigoplus}G}{R^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%5Cfrac%7Bv%5E2%7D%7BR%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BmM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7BR%5E2%7D)

and so you see now that the orbital speed is

![v = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\bigoplus}G}{R}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7BM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7BR%7D%7D)

If you know R, then you can calculate the speed in orbit.

If you know the speed in orbit, you can calculate R.

And so the period of going around in the orbit, 

![T = \frac{2\pi R}{v} = 2\pi R \sqrt{\frac{R}{M_{\bigoplus}G}} = \frac{2\pi R^{3/2}}{\sqrt{M_{\bigoplus} G}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%20R%7D%7Bv%7D%20%3D%202%5Cpi%20R%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7BR%7D%7BM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%20R%5E%7B3/2%7D%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7BM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7D%20G%7D%7D)

If we take the shuttle as an example of a near-Earth orbit...

* the shuttle may be 400 km above the Earth's surface
* the radius of orbit is 6,800 km
* T is about 90 minutes.
* v is very close to 8 km/s

If you take the moon--

* the distance to the moon is some 385,000 km
* T is about 27.5 days.
* v is only 1 km/s

If you take the Earth itself around the sun--

* replace the equation with the mass of the sun, 2 x 10<sup>30</sup> kg
* the distance from the Earth to the sun is about 150,000,000 km.
* T is about 365.5 days
* v is about 30 km/s

Jupiter is five times further away than the Earth, and so the time for Jupiter to go around the sun is about 12 years.

Notice that __this period is independent of the mass of the little satellite__

> unfortunate for the Americans as they were unable to calculate the mass of the Sputnik when it was launched by the Russians on October 4, 1957
it's independent of mass.

There is something remarkable about these numbers.

I take the total mechanical energy--

![\mathrm{ME} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 - \frac{mMG}{r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BME%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20mv%5E2%20-%20%5Cfrac%7BmMG%7D%7Br%7D)

and substitute in the orbital speed--then I get

![\mathrm{ME} = -\frac{mMG}{2r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BME%7D%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7BmMG%7D%7B2r%7D)

And so now I have

![\mathrm{ME} = \frac{1}{2} U = -\mathrm{KE}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BME%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20U%20%3D%20-%5Cmathrm%7BKE%7D)

## Power

__What is power?__ 

Power is work that is done in a certain amount of time.

![\mathrm{Power} = \frac{dW}{dt}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BPower%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BdW%7D%7Bdt%7D)

The units of power is joules per second, for which we often write W, which is named after the physicist Watt.

The little bit of work done by a constant force over a  a short, small displacement is

![dW = \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?dW%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%5Ccdot%20d%5Cvec%7Br%7D)

Take time derivative of this, we get

![P = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D)

If the force were perpendicular at all times to the velocity vector, then the power is zero.

Let's take an example.

I am on a bicycle--

![Riding a bike][3]

and I'm trying to get going with a constant velocity.

And the air drag acts on me, F drag, and I, Walter Lewin, will have to to overcome this drag force to keep the speed constant--

How do I do that? 

Well, I push on the pedals. But the pedals push back on me. Internal forces cancel.

Now, the pedals push on the chain, the chain pushes on the wheel, the wheel pushes onto the road, and the road pushes back.

So ultimately it is really the friction that allows me to cycle.

The power that I have to deliver is an extremely strong function of the speed.

If we are in regime II, which is the pressure-dominated regime, then the drag force is proportional to v<sup>2</sup>.

Let's say F<sub>drag</sub> = k v<sup>2</sup>.

Then if I have

<style>
table, th, td {
	border-collapse: collapse;
	border: 1px solid black;
}
th {
	background-color: #ccc;
}
</style>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>v</th>
		<th>P</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>10 mph</td>
		<td>0.02 hp (~15 W)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>25 mph</td>
		<td>0.3 hp (~230 W)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

* 1 hp = 746 W

The power that I have to generate is the dot product between the force and the velocity.

P = kv<sup>3</sup>

## Heat and Various Forms of Energy

There is also heat energy, and heat energy is expressed in terms of calories.

And a calorie is defined as the energy needed to increase 1 g of water by 1 degree centigrade.

And so in general we can write that 

![Q = m C \Delta T](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q%20%3D%20m%20C%20%5CDelta%20T)

where Q is heat energy in calories, m is the mass of the object, and C is the specific heat, which for water would be 1 calorie per gram per degree centigrade, and &Delta;T is the temperature increase that we apply.

Specific heat for various materials:

* Aluminum: 0.2
* Lead: 0.03
* Ice: 0.5

The physicist James Joules, who we call after him the unit of work--

was the first to demonstrate that heat energy and mechanical energy are really equivalent.

He did an ingenious experiment such that he takes objects with masses hanging from strings and lowers them in a gravitational field over a certain distance.

And he uses this rope to rotate scoops which are in water.

There is mechanical energy coming out of the scoops, and he noticed that the temperature of the water goes up.

He found that one calorie is approximately 4.2 J.

So there is a direct connection between the two.

When we burn something, there is a chemical reaction which produces heat, in many cases.

Gasoline produces per gallon something like close to a 100,000,000 joules.

Your body produces heat.

Your body is roughly at a temperature of 98 degrees Fahrenheit, unless you happen to run a high fever today.

And your body is radiating electromagnetic radiation in infrared frequency.

That is about 100 J/s that you radiate--100 W.

You radiate at the same level as a 100W light bulb, but distributed over a much larger area, so you're not as hot as a 100W light bulb.

It means that you in 1 day, you generate in terms of heat about 10<sup>7</sup> joules

and that is about 2,000,000 calories per day.

__Where does the body get it from?__

Food.

You better eat 2,000,000 calories per day.

When you read on the packages "calories," it really means kilocalorie.

So you have to eat roughly daily about 2,000 kilocalories' equivalent of food.

__How about mechanical work?__

Suppose we walk up three floors, which is about 10 m high.

And let's say we do that 5 times per day.

And let's give you a mass of about 70 kilograms.

__How much work do I do?__

Well, the amount of work that I do is mgh.

70 x 10 x (5 x 10) = 35,000 J

Compare that with the 10<sup>7</sup> J per day that your body generates in terms of heat.

Suppose you took 10 hours to walk up the stairs 5 times a day.

Then, the average power is about 1 W.

So, it is completely negligible.

However, if you climb a mountain--5,000 feet--then the work you have to do is a 1,000,000 joules.

And if you do that in 2 hours, the power that you have generated would be on average 160 watts--more than the body heat--during those two hours, of course.

Suppose I wanted to take a bath, and I want to calculate how much energy it takes to heat the bath--

* m = 100 kg
* &Delta;T = 50 degrees centigrade, which is the same as 50 degrees Kelvin

You'll find that Q then becomes roughly 5,000 kilocalories--

> Professor Lewin mentions several forms of energy, and the possible conversion between them

### Demo: converting mechanical energy to electric energy

* student uses a mechanical-electric generator to power 20-watt light bulb
* a human being is unable to generate at least 120 W mechanical energy

## Energy Conversion

Batteries convert chemical energy to electricity directly.

If I have a beaker with acid, for which most commonly is used sulfuric acid, and I put here in a zinc wire and here in a copper wire, then this is a battery.

![Acid battery][4]

### Demo: Acid battery

* put several acid battries in series to power a light-bulb

Now, we all know when you really need batteries, they're dead.

When you're in the mountains and you need your flashlight because it's really an emergency, it just so happens that the batteries are dead.

And therefore almost every mountaineer has with him or her a device which converts mechanical energy into electricity.

### Demo: a mechanical flashlight

* Professor Lewin tried to show it, but unfortunately the bulb is broken

## Global Energy Consumption and Sources

The world energy consumption of the entire world of 6,000,000,000 people--

is about 4 x 10<sup>20</sup> joules per year.

That is the entire consumption.

The United States has only 1/30 of the world population and consumes 1/5 of that.

We are really energy spoilers, big energy spoilers.

The sun is a wonderful source of energy.

The sun has a P = 4 x 10<sup>26</sup> W -- mostly in the visible light and some in the infrared.

You can calculate how much of that energy reaches the Earth at the distance of 150,000,000 km.

And so that energy goes out radially, symmetrically, isotropically in all directions.

You know that the surface area of the sphere is 4&pi;r<sup>2</sup>, and so you can calculate how much for every square meter reaches the Earth.

That is 1,400 W/m<sup>2</sup>.

* we would need the size of Holland to absorb enough solar energy to satisfy the world consumption of energy
* if we take day and night, cloud, conversion efficiency of solar cells and incident angle into account, we would require the whole of England and France.

So solar energy plays a very small role in our world economy.

Nuclear energy, which is the fission of uranium or plutonium, was very popular in the '70s, but it has become a little bit less popular lately.

We had the Three Mile Island accident in our own country, and you've heard just a few weeks ago about the nasty accident that there was in Japan.

So people are, understandably so, emotionally strongly biased against the use of nuclear energy.

But nuclear energy is all around me, at least every day.

I have a very special collection of Fiestaware, which is American tableware which was designed and built in the '30s, in 1937, and it went on until the '50s.

> Professor Lewin showed some of his collection of Fiestaware

> a plate and a cup, which are colored orange, has uranium oxide in it

> He used a Geiger tube to measure the gamma rays that the uranium emits when it spontaneously breaks up in pieces and energy is released--

We have fossil fuel on Earth.

We are consuming at this moment the fossil fuel at a rate which is a 1,000,000 times faster than nature could create it--

And if we consume it at the present rate, or increase maybe by only 3% per year, then we won't have any left in less than 100 years.

So we have an energy crisis--and we have also an environmental problem, because all these power plants and all the industries cause pollution.

And so what are we going to do about it? 

My own energy consumption is quite modest. If I add up all forms of energy that I consume, I think I consume roughly 400,000,000 joules per day.

That is the equivalent of having 100 slaves working for me 12 hours a day.

For 1 kWh of electricity, which is 4,000,000 joules, I pay only 10 cents.

My entire energy bill for those 100 slaves is no more than $150 a month.

__How are we going to continue this?__

Because we are running out of fossil fuel, and nuclear energy has its problems.

Well, the only way that we might maintain our quality of life is nuclear fusion.

If you could merge deuterium with deuterium, you gain energy.

Now, 1/6,000 hydrogen atoms on Earth is deuterium, and we have a 1000,000,000 km<sup>3</sup> of water.

It is unclear whether we will ever succeed in making a fusion reactor working.

But if we succeeded, then simply the oceans would provide the world, if we consume the energy at the same rate as we are consuming today--

4 x 10<sup>20</sup> joules per year--

we would have enough energy for 25,000,000,000 years.

All the worries are over, because the Earth is not going to survive for any more than 5,000,000,000 years.

Five billion years from now, the sun will become a hundred times bigger than it is now, and it will just swallow up the world, and it will be the end of MIT, of everything.

### Brain Teaser:

I have here a very special ball.

* bounced off the floor
* the ball starts blinking for a few seconds before it stops

__Where does the energy come from of the blinking light?__

Think about the fact that they continue to blink and then stop.
