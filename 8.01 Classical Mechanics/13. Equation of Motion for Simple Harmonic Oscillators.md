## Gravitational Potential Energy

If I have an object, mass m, in gravitational field, 

![Object in gravitational field][1]

then the gravitational force, vectorially written, 

![\vec{F} = -mg \hat{y}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%3D%20-mg%20%5Chat%7By%7D)

Since this is a one-dimensional problem, we will often simply write 

F = -mg

This minus sign is important because that's in the decreasing value of y.

If the bottom level here is y = 0, then I could call this level U = 0.

And the top level is y...its gravitational potential energy here, U = +mgy.

So if I make a plot of the gravitational potential energy as a function of y, then I would get a straight line.

![Gravitational potential energy near Earth][2]

If I move the object from point A to point B, I, Walter Lewin, have to do positive work. Notice that the gravitational potential energy increases. The gravity is doing negative work.

If I move the object from point A to some other point, call it B'--then I do negative work. Notice the gravitational potential energy goes down. The gravity then is doing positive work.

I could have chosen my zero point of potential energy anywhere I please.

Nothing would change other than that I offset the zero point of my potential energy.

But again, if I go from A to B, the gravitational potential energy increases by exactly the same amount--I have to do exactly the same work.

So when you are near Earth, you are free to choose where the zero is.

### Gravitational Potential Energy not near the Earth

Now we take the situation whereby we are not so close to the Earth.

![Gravitational Potential Energy not near the Earth][3]

According to Newton's Universal Law of Gravity--the gravitational force on this object equals

![\vec{F} = -\frac{mM_{\bigoplus}G}{r^2} \hat{r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7BmM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7Br%5E2%7D%20%5Chat%7Br%7D)

Since it is really one-dimensional, we could simply write it this way.

![F = -\frac{mM_{\bigoplus}G}{r^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7BmM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7Br%5E2%7D)

The gravitational potential energy we derived last time equals 

![U = -\frac{mM_{\bigoplus}G}{r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7BmM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7Br%7D)--

and if you plot that, then the plot goes sort of like this.

![U vs r][4]

If I move away from the earth, with a mass m in my hand, notice that the gravitational potential energy increases. I have to do positive work, there is no difference.

If I move closer to the Earth, notice that the gravitational potential energy decreases. I do negative work.

Right here near Earth, where this 1/r curve hits the Earth, the tangent line would be exactly U = mgy so then you can simplify matters when you are near Earth.

__The force is always in the direction opposite the increasing potential energy__.

If I release an object at zero speed, it therefore will always move towards a lower potential energy because the force will drive it to lower potential energy.

## Calculating U(x) from F(x) and Vice Versa

I have a spring which is relaxed length l--call this x = 0--

and I extend it over a distance x and there's a mass m at the end

and there will be a spring force.

And that spring force...

F = -kx.

![Extending a spring][5]

I can calculate the work that I have to do to bring it from A to B.

![W_{WL} = \int_A^B Fdx = \int_0^x kxdx = \frac{1}{2} kx^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?W_%7BWL%7D%20%3D%20%5Cint_A%5EB%20Fdx%20%3D%20%5Cint_0%5Ex%20kxdx%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20kx%5E2)

And this is what we call __the potential energy of the spring__.

At x = 0, we define potential energy to be zero.

So if you now make a plot of the potential energy as a function of x, you get a parabola.

![Potential Energy of a Spring][6]

The force is always in the direction opposing the increasing potential energy.

You see, it's a restoring force.

If we know the force--we were able to calculate the potential energy.

__Suppose we knew the potential energy, can we find the force?__ 

And the answer is yes, we can.

Let's take the situation of the spring first.

We have that the potential energy 

![U = \frac{1}{2} kx^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20kx%5E2)

and if I take the derivative of that versus x then I get +kx, but the force, the spring force itself, is -kx, so 

![\frac{dU}{dx} = -F_x](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7BdU%7D%7Bdx%7D%20%3D%20-F_x)

The minus sign is telling you that the force is always pointing in the direction which is opposite to increasing values of the potential energy.

If we have a three-dimensional situation that we know the potential energy as a function of x, y and z, then we can go back and find the forces as a function of x, y and z.

It doesn't matter whether these are springs or whether it is gravity or whether it's electric forces or nuclear forces, you then find that 

![\frac{\partial U}{\partial x} = -F_x](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20U%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20x%7D%20%3D%20-F_x)

![\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} = -F_y](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20U%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20y%7D%20%3D%20-F_y)

![\frac{\partial U}{\partial z} = -F_z](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20U%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20z%7D%20%3D%20-F_z)

If we go back to the situation where we had gravity near Earth.

We had U = mgy, so what is dU/dy? 

That is +mg, and notice that the gravitational force was -mg.

And so you see that here, indeed, 

![F = -\frac{dU}{dy} = -mg](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7BdU%7D%7Bdy%7D%20%3D%20-mg)

Now we take the situation that we are not near Earth--

Here we have 

![U = -\frac{mM_{\bigoplus}G}{r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7BmM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7Br%7D)

So the gravitational force equals

![F_g = -\frac{dU}{dr} = -\frac{mM_{\bigoplus}G}{r^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_g%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7BdU%7D%7Bdr%7D%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7BmM_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7DG%7D%7Br%5E2%7D)

So whenever you know the potential as a function of space, you can always find the three components of the forces in the three orthogonal directions.

## Equilibrium Points

Suppose I have a curved surface--

![Curved surface][7]

So this is a function y = f(x) and the curve itself represents effectively the gravitational potential energy.

So the gravitational potential energy U = mgy = mg f(x)

There are points here where dU/dx = 0. 

It means that the component of the force in the x direction--is zero.

So if we visit those points, then there is, of course, gravity, mg, in the -y direction and there is a normal force in the +y direction and these two exactly cancel each other.

So the net result is that there is no force on the object at all, so the object is going to stay put.

However, some points are __stable equilibrium__, and some points are __unstable equilibrium__.

We have a curved track here, and I would like to show you how that will work.

* put a little ball at various equilibrium points
* At the stable point, the second derivative of the potential energy versus x is positive.
* At the unstable point, the second derivative is negative.

## Parabolic Potential Energy Well ==> SHO

I'm going to return now to my spring and I'm going to show you that if you use the potential energy of the spring alone that you can show that an object that oscillates on a spring follows a simple harmonic motion.

![Potential energy of a spring][8]

Since spring forces are conservative forces, I can now apply the conservation of mechanical energy.

We call this a __potential well__.

The object is going to oscillate in a potential well.

![\frac{1}{2} k x_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2} kx^2 + \frac{1}{2} mv^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20k%20x_%7Bmax%7D%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20kx%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20mv%5E2)

![\frac{1}{2} k x_{max}^2 = \frac{1}{2} kx^2 + \frac{1}{2} m{\dot x}^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20k%20x_%7Bmax%7D%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20kx%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m%7B%5Cdot%20x%7D%5E2)

![\frac{1}{2} m{\dot x}^2 + \frac{1}{2} kx^2 = \frac{1}{2} k x_{max}^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m%7B%5Cdot%20x%7D%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20kx%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20k%20x_%7Bmax%7D%5E2)

![\frac{1}{2} {\dot x}^2 + \frac{k}{2m} x^2 = \frac{k}{2m} x_{max}^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%7B%5Cdot%20x%7D%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7B2m%7D%20x%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7B2m%7D%20x_%7Bmax%7D%5E2)

And now I'm going to take the time derivative of this equation.

![{\dot x}{\ddot x} + \frac{k}{m} x{\dot x} = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7B%5Cdot%20x%7D%7B%5Cddot%20x%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bm%7D%20x%7B%5Cdot%20x%7D%20%3D%200)

![{\ddot x} + \frac{k}{m} x = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7B%5Cddot%20x%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bm%7D%20x%20%3D%200)

And this is a simple harmonic oscillation.

We know the solution to this equation...

![x = x_{max}\cos(\omega t + \phi)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%20%3D%20x_%7Bmax%7D%5Ccos%28%5Comega%20t%20&plus;%20%5Cphi%29)

![\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Bk%7D%7Bm%7D%7D)

We were able to apply the conservation of mechanical energy because spring forces are conservative forces.

## Circular Potential Energy Well ==> SHO

Now I'm going to try something similar to another potential well and that potential well is a track and the track is a perfect circle.

And I'm going to slide down that track an object mass m, and I'm going to evaluate the oscillation along a perfect circular track.

![Circular Track][9]

![U = mgy = mgR(1-\cos \theta)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?U%20%3D%20mgy%20%3D%20mgR%281-%5Ccos%20%5Ctheta%29)

The velocity of that object is given by 

![v(\theta) = R \frac{d\theta}{t}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v%28%5Ctheta%29%20%3D%20R%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Ctheta%7D%7Bt%7D)

So I can now apply the conservation of mechanical energy

![\mathrm{ME} = \frac{1}{2} m R^2 {\dot \theta}^2 + mgR(1-\cos \theta)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BME%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m%20R%5E2%20%7B%5Cdot%20%5Ctheta%7D%5E2%20&plus;%20mgR%281-%5Ccos%20%5Ctheta%29)

And this is always the same, independent of the angle of theta, because gravity is a conservative force.

This cosine theta is really a pain in the neck, and therefore we are going to make a small angle approximation...

And we're going to write 

![\cos \theta = 1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ccos%20%5Ctheta%20%3D%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctheta%5E2%7D%7B2%7D)

We cannot use the earlier approximation that simply said cos(&theta;) = 0.

If we did this, we would end up with nonsense, because it would say that the mechanical energy is changing all the time because this velocity is changing all the time.

The approximation is really amazingly good.

<style>
table, th, td {
	border-collapse: collapse;
	border: 1px solid black;
}
th {
	background-color: #ccc;
}
</style>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>&theta; (radian)</th>
		<th>cos(&theta;)</th>
		<th>1-&theta;<sup>2</sup>/2</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1/60</td>
		<td>0.999861114</td>
		<td>0.999861111</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1/5</td>
		<td>0.98007</td>
		<td>0.98000</td>
	</tr>
</table>

So with this in mind, I feel comfortable to pursue my conservation of mechanical energy.

And I'm going to replace this cos(&theta;) by 1 - &theta;<sup>2</sup>/2

![\mathrm{ME} = \frac{1}{2} m R^2 {\dot \theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} mgR\theta^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BME%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m%20R%5E2%20%7B%5Cdot%20%5Ctheta%7D%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20mgR%5Ctheta%5E2)

And now I take the time derivative...

![0 = m R^2 \dot\theta \ddot\theta + mgR\theta \dot\theta](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0%20%3D%20m%20R%5E2%20%5Cdot%5Ctheta%20%5Cddot%5Ctheta%20&plus;%20mgR%5Ctheta%20%5Cdot%5Ctheta)

and what do I find? 

![\ddot\theta + \frac{g}{R}\theta = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cddot%5Ctheta%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7BR%7D%5Ctheta%20%3D%200)

And this tells me that the motion is that of a simple harmonic oscillation.

And the solution is 

![\theta = \theta_{max} \cos(\omega t + \phi)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta%20%3D%20%5Ctheta_%7Bmax%7D%20%5Ccos%28%5Comega%20t%20&plus;%20%5Cphi%29)

where

![\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7BR%7D%7D) is the angular frequency 

and

![T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{R}{g}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%202%5Cpi%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7BR%7D%7Bg%7D%7D) is the period.

We have seen this before!

We had a pendulum whereby we had length l of a massless string.

Gravity is the only force that does work and so it is justified to use the conservation of mechanical energy because gravity is a conservative force.

In the case of the spring, we had that the potential energy was proportional to x<sup>2</sup> and out came a perfect simple harmonic oscillation, no approximation necessary.

Now we forced this potential energy...into being dependent on &theta;<sup>2</sup>.

And by the approximation of cos(&theta;) being 1 - &theta;<sup>2</sup>/2, we forced this term to become quadratic in &theta; and therefore now, with that approximation it becomes a perfect simple harmonic oscillation.

Now comes a key question.

__Is gravity is really the only force that does work?__

YES.

__Is the tension not doing any work? Is the normal force not doing any work?__

YES. The force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion.

## Sliding on a Circular Track ==> SHO

We do have a circular track.

* a circular arc, radius = 115 &plusmn; 5 m

Prediction:

![T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{R}{g}} = 21.5 \pm 0.5](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%202%5Cpi%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7BR%7D%7Bg%7D%7D%20%3D%2021.5%20%5Cpm%200.5) sec

Observation:

3T = 64.05 &plusmn; 0.1 sec

T = 21.35 &plusmn; 0.03 sec

### Demo: Rolling ball on a circular track

* the radius is 85 &plusmn; 1 cm

Prediction:

T = 1.85 &plusmn; 0.01 sec

Observation:

10T = 22.7 &plusmn; 0.1 sec

T = 2.27 &plusmn; 0.01 sec

> the difference is that one is sliding, the other is rolling
