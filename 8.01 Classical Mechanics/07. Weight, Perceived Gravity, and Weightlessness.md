## What is Weight?

__What is weight?__

![Define weight][1]

* You stand on a bathroom scale
* Gravity is acting upon you, the force is mg, your mass is m.
* The bathroom scale is pushing on you with a force F_scale
* F_scale = mg
* F_scale is defined as weight

### Example: Weight in an elevator accelerating upwards

![Weight inside an elevator accelerating upwards][2]

* You stand on a bathroom scale inside an elevator
* The elevator is accelerating upwards

![F_s - mg = ma](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_s%20-%20mg%20%3D%20ma)

![F_s = m(a + g)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_s%20%3D%20m%28a%20&plus;%20g%29)

And You have gained weight.

### Example: Weight in an elevator accelerating downwards

![Weight inside an elevator accelerating downwards][3]

* You stand on a bathroom scale inside an elevator
* The elevator is accelerating downwards

![mg - F_s = ma](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20-%20F_s%20%3D%20ma)

![F_s = m(g - a)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_s%20%3D%20m%28g%20-%20a%29)

And You've lost weight.

### Example: Weight in a free fall

* Suppose now I cut the cable...
* F_s = m(g - a) = 0

You are now __weightless__, you are __free-fall__ing.

* If you had a glass with water, you could turn it over and the water would not fall out.
* the shuttle in orbit with the astronauts being weightless

__What exactly is free fall?__

* Free fall is when the forces acting upon you are exclusively gravitational.

__How could I determine your weight if I hang you from a string?__

![Determine weight when hanging from a string][4]

![T = mg](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%20mg)

I read the scale and I read my weight.

* For accelerating upwards and downwards, the analysis stays the same

## Tension in Massless String

![Hanging two masses over a frictionless pin][5]

* a frictionless pin
* a massless string wrapped around the pin
* two objects with mass m1 and m2, hanged on each side
* m2 > m1
* m2 will be accelerated down
* m1 will be accelerated up

Claim: ![T_L = T_R](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_L%20%3D%20T_R)

__Why is that?__

* because the pin is frictionless, and the string is massless.
* Take a little section of the string
* If the tensions were different, the section of the string would get an infinite acceleration (since it is massless).

If there is friction in the pin--then that's not the case.

Given the fact that the tension left and the tension right are the same, I must now conclude that __these two objects have the same weight__.

Let us calculate the acceleration of this system and let's calculate the tension and let's see what comes out.

![Force diagram of object number 1][5]

![T - m_1 g = m_1 a ](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20-%20m_1%20g%20%3D%20m_1%20a)

![T = m_1 (a + g)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%20m_1%20%28a%20&plus;%20g%29)

Notice m1 gains weight.

![Force diagram of object number 2][6]

![m_2 g - T = m_2 a](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_2%20g%20-%20T%20%3D%20m_2%20a)

![T = m_2 (g - a)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%20m_2%20%28g%20-%20a%29)

Two equations with two unknowns.

Solve these two equations, we get

![a = \frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2} g](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_2%20-%20m_1%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7D%20g)

![T = \frac{2 m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} g](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%20m_1%20m_2%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7D%20g)

Let's scrutinize these equations a little.

e.g. m1 = m2 = m, a = 0, T = mg

e.g. m2 >> m1, a = g, T = 0

Return to the case where m2 > m1

* since m1 is being accelerated upwards, it gained weight
* since m2 is being accelerated downwards, it lost weight

Prediction: 

![m_1 g < T < m_2 g](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1%20g%20%3C%20T%20%3C%20m_2%20g)

e.g. m1 = 1.1 kg, m2 = 1.25 kg

__What is the acceleration "a" of the system?__

a ~ 0.064 g

__What is the tension?__

T ~ 1.17 g

## Weight, when Swinging around on a String

Return to swinging around in a vertical plane

![Swinging around in a vertical plane][8]

* radius, R
* constant angular velocity, omega

Look at the bottom point P first

![T = m (a_c + g)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%20m%20%28a_c%20&plus;%20g%29)

* similar to being accelerated upwards in an elevator

Let's now look at the situation at S.

![T = m (g - a_c)](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%20m%20%28g%20-%20a_c%29)

* similar to being accelerated upwards in an elevator
* This object is losing weight.

e.g. a_c = 10, T = 0, weightless!

e.g. a_c > 10, T > 0, T = your weight

e.g. a_c < 10, meaningless, T can never be negative. What it means is that the bucket of water would never have made it to this point.

## Objects in Free Fall are Weightless

Professor Lewin jumps off a table with a jug of water in his hand

1. Stand on a table: Normal weight
2. Jump off a table: Weightless
3. Impact time: Weight more
4. Stop: Normal weight

How can I show you that we are weightless? 

Well, if I don't have to use my muscles to push on this bottle upwards I might as well lower my hands a little bit during this free fall.

And you will see that __the bottle will just stay above my hands__ without my having to push up.

What happens when I hit the floor? 

* I hit the floor with a downward velocity of about 5 m/s
* assume impact time to about 2/10 s
* then the average acceleration will be 25 m/s^2 or 2.5 g
* that means I will weigh 3.5 times of my normal weight.

## Weight Measurements of a Free Falling Object

* Jump off the table with bathroom scale tied under the feet
* However, bathroom scales have very slow response time

Professor Dave made a scale with response time of 10 ms

* 4.5 pounds for the platform
* tape down a 10 lb barbell on top
* drop it from a height to a cushioned box
* also showed on an electronic scale in fractions of a second
* sees oscillation since it is being thrown back to the air

## Professor Young's "Zero Gravity" Experiments

Professor Young and Professor Oman here at the Aeronautics Department have done what they call "zero gravity experiments" from airplanes--

![Professor Young's "Zero Gravity" Experiment][9]

"zero gravity" is a complete misnomer.

"Zero weight," yes--
"zero gravity," no.

* They fly an airplane, which is the KC-135
* They do these experiments at an altitude of about 30,000 feet.
* The plane comes in at an angle of about 45 degrees.
* The speed is about 425 mi/hr
* The horizontal component is about 300 mi/hr
* The vertical component is about 300 mi/hr

The engine is then cut; the plane goes to free-fall; the plane will follow the path of a parabola.

__What is the time that the velocity in the y direction comes to zero?__

~15 sec

__How much higher would it have travelled?__

~900 m
 
It will take about 30 seconds to go from where the engine is cut off to being at the same level again.

In those 30 seconds, the horizontal displacement is about 3.5 km.

The plane is going to pull up, it goes into this phase and then the plane flies horizontally for a while.

During this phase, there will be weight increase since there is an acceleration upwards.

And then when flying horizontally, they have again normal weight.

* the reason why these flights are done is to study motion sickness under weightless conditions.
