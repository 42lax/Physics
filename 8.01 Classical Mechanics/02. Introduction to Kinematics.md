## Introduction to 1-Dimensional Motion

I have a motion of an object along a straight line--

We'll call that __one-dimensional motion__.

Diagram below shows the position of the object, x, at various points in time (t1, t2, t3, t4, t5)

![1D motion of an object at various points in time][1]

Now we will introduce what we call the __average velocity__.

* I put a bar over it.
* That stands for average between time t1 and time t2.

![\bar{v}_{t_1 t_2} = {{x_{t_2} - x_{t_1}} \over {t_2 - t_1}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7Bv%7D_%7Bt_1%20t_2%7D%20%3D%20%7B%7Bx_%7Bt_2%7D%20-%20x_%7Bt_1%7D%7D%20%5Cover%20%7Bt_2%20-%20t_1%7D%7D)

* could be > 0 (t1 -> t2), = 0 (t1 -> t5), < 0 (t2 -> t4)
* choice of 0 on x-axis is unimportant
* choice of +ve direction of x-axis is important
* __the direction determines the signs__.
* __Signs in physics do matter.__

Diagram below is an x-t diagram that shows exactly where the object is at any moment in time.

![x-t diagram of an object in 1D motion][2]

* choice of 0-point is unimportant but need it to make a graph

![\bar{v} = {\Delta x \over \Delta t}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbar%7Bv%7D%20%3D%20%7B%5CDelta%20x%20%5Cover%20%5CDelta%20t%7D)

* be careful about the sign convention
* sign of average velocity depends on the angle of the secant line

## Average Speed vs. Average Velocity

There is a very big difference in physics between speed and velocity.

![\textup{average speed} = {\textup{distance traveled} \over \textup{time taken}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctextup%7Baverage%20speed%7D%20%3D%20%7B%5Ctextup%7Bdistance%20traveled%7D%20%5Cover%20%5Ctextup%7Btime%20taken%7D%7D)

__What is the distance that the object traveled between time t1 and time t5?__ 

* have to add up all the distances, irrespective to what direction the object is travelling

![average speed needs the distance travelled][3]

e.g. If the distance altogether were 300 m and the time between t1 and t5 were 3 s, then the average speed would be 300 m / 3 s = 100 m/s. Yet yet the average velocity would be 0 m/s.

## Instantaneous Velocity

__The instantaneous velocity__, v, at time t is defined to be 

![v_t = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x_{t+\Delta t} - x_t}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_t%20%3D%20%5Clim_%7B%5CDelta%20t%20%5Cto%200%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Bx_%7Bt&plus;%5CDelta%20t%7D%20-%20x_t%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bdx%7D%7Bdt%7D)

* can be recognized as the first derivative of the position w.r.t. time

> ![v = \frac{dx}{dt}](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bdx%7D%7Bdt%7D)

* can be either > 0, = 0, or < 0, depending on tangential angle
* look for velocity is zero where the derivative is zero

__What are the times that the velocity is positive?__

* look for positive slope

__What is the instantaneous speed?__

* speed is not sign-sensitive
* __the speed is the magnitude of the velocity__

e.g. the velocity of -100 m/s is lower than the velocity of +30 m/s, but the speed is higher

## Measuring the Average Speed of a Bullet

__How can I measure the average speed of a bullet?__

* two parallel wires, seperated by D meters
* bullet would break those wires
* when wire I breaks, timer starts
* when wire II breaks, timer stops

![Setup for measuring the average speed of a bullet][4]

> the wire are not exactly parallel, the wire may be deformed upon bullet impact before breaking
> Hence, the uncertainly in measuring D would be higher

So the distance between the 2 wires, D, is measured to be 

148.5 &plusmn; 0.5 cm.

> only about 5/1500 or 1/300 = 1/3% error (__relative error__)

I want to measure the accuracy of the speed of the bullet to about 2%.

__How accurate should I do the timing?__

Suppose the speed of the bullet is lower than the speed of sound, which is 340 m/s, say 300 m/s

Then it would take 5 ms for this bullet to travel the distance between the wires.

And if I want to make a measurement to 2% accuracy, the timing error must be less than about 1/10 ms because 1/10 ms is about 2% of 5 ms.

The timing measurement is

5.8 &plusmn; 0.1 ms

And so this is the result.

![\frac{D}{t} = \frac{148.5 \pm 0.5 cm}{5.8 \pm 0.1 ms} = 256 \pm 4 m/s](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7BD%7D%7Bt%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B148.5%20%5Cpm%200.5%20%5C%3A%20cm%7D%7B5.8%20%5Cpm%200.1%20%5C%3A%20ms%7D%20%3D%20256%20%5Cpm%204%20%5C%3A%20m/s)

## Introducing Average Acceleration

The __average acceleration__ between time t1 and time t2 would be

![\bar{a}_{t_1 t_2} = \frac{v_{t_2} - v_{t_1}}{t_2 - t_1} m/s^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%7Ba%7D_%7Bt_1%20t_2%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bv_%7Bt_2%7D%20-%20v_%7Bt_1%7D%7D%7Bt_2%20-%20t_1%7D%20%5C%3B%20m/s%5E2)

* this number can be > 0, = 0, < 0
* the sign depends on the direction of positive x-axis, not the zero point

You can also write down that average acceleration using the difference quotient but you must be careful about the sign convention.

![\bar{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%7Ba%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20v%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%7D)

### Example:

I have here a tennis ball and I can bounce this tennis ball, I can throw it down.

Assume that it hits the floor at about 5 m/s, and it also bounces back with a velocity of about 5 m/s.

![Tennis ball bouncing off the floor][5]

__What is the average acceleration?__

I would have to know the time that it takes for this change in direction.

In other words, we call that the __impact time__.

Assume the impact time to be about 1/100 s

![\bar{a} = \frac{10}{10^2} = +10^3 m/s^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%7Ba%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B10%7D%7B10%5E2%7D%20%3D%20&plus;10%5E3%20%5C%3B%20m/s%5E2)

### Example:

I have also here a tomato and I have here some eggs.

Now, imagine now that I throw the tomato or the egg down and that they hit the floor at 5 m/s. They would not come back up. Therefore, the change in velocity would  only be 5 m/s.

The impact time would probably be much longer, maybe a 1/4 s.

So therefore the average acceleration during the impact would only be 

5 / (1/4) = 20 m/s^2.

> Sign convention matters for the calculation; but Physics does not change

__Something breaks because the magnitude of acceleration becomes too high.__

> Professor Lewin told a Sherlock Holmes story about a guy crushed his skull when fell on the floor

And when the impact time is short even if you hit the floor with a modest speed the acceleration is high...that was too much and so that's why his skull was crushed.

__What matters is this changing velocity and the impact time__.

## Instantaneous Acceleration

The acceleration at any moment in time will be 

![a\_t = \lim\_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{v\_{t + \Delta t}}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_t%20%3D%20%5Clim_%7B%5CDelta%20t%20%5Cto%200%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Bv_%7Bt%20&plus;%20%5CDelta%20t%7D%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bdv%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%20x%7D%7Bdt%5E2%7D)

That is the __instantaneous acceleration__.

And this, you will recognize is the __first derivative of velocity versus time__, which is also the __second derivative of position versus time__.

> Remember this

> ![a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bdv%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5E2%20x%7D%7Bdt%5E2%7D)

We can go to our plot and ask:

__Where is the acceleration = 0, > 0, < 0?__ 

Look at how the slope is changing.

## Quadratic Equation of Position in Time

I'm going to give you the position x as a function of time and then ask you lots of questions about it.

### Example:

![x = 8 - 6t + t^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20%3D%208%20-%206t%20&plus;%20t%5E2) m

__What is the velocity at any moment in time?__ 

Well, that's the derivative dx/dt

--and I will be using the differentiation rule for

![x = t^n](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20%3D%20t%5En)

Then, as most of you should know 

![\frac{dx}{dt} = n t^{n-1}](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bdx%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20n%20t%5E%7Bn-1%7D)

Then, I would get

![v = -6 + 2t](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20%3D%20-6%20&plus;%202t) m/s

and the acceleration...

![a = +2](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%3D%20&plus;2) m/s^2

So notice that the acceleration is constant in time but the velocity is changing.

At time t = 0, x is +8, the velocity is -6 m/s and the acceleration equals +2.

__At what time does x = 0?__

Solve the quadratic equation to get t = +2 or t = +4.

__When is the velocity zero?__ 

t = 3

__What is, at that moment, the position?__

Substitute t = 3 and that gives me x= -1.

So now I'm ready to plot x as a function of t.

![Plot x-v diagram][6]

## 1D Motion with Constant Acceleration

I now would like to write down, in most general form the equation for the position and the velocity as a function of time for a one-dimensional motion whereby the acceleration is constant.

So it's going to be one-dimensional again and the acceleration, a, is going to be a constant.

So we're going to get 

![x = C_1 + C_2 t + C_3 t^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20%3D%20C_1%20&plus;%20C_2%20t%20&plus;%20C_3%20t%5E2)

I can now take the derivative and so I get 

![v = C_2  + 2 C_3 t](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v%20%3D%20C_2%20&plus;%202%20C_3%20t)

and

![a= 2 C_3](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%3D%202%20C_3)

Clearly, C1 is the position of x at time t = 0

![C_1 = x_0](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_1%20%3D%20x_0)

C2 is really the velocity at time t = 0

![C_2 = v_0](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_2%20%3D%20v_0)

And the acceleration is not changing with time. It's 2C3.

Therefore,

![C_3 = \frac{1}{2} a](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C_3%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20a)

When an object is influenced by the gravitational acceleration and the gravitational acceleration is a constant.

And we write, often for that gravitational acceleration, the letter "g".

In Boston, g is 9.80 m/s^2 and it varies a little bit for different places on Earth.

![g = 9.80](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?g%20%3D%209.80)  m/s^2

This gravitational acceleration is independent 

* of the mass of the object that I drop, 
* of the speed of the object,
* of the chemical composition of the object,
* of the size of the object and 
* of the shape of the object 

assuming that we have no air drag, that these experiments are done in...in vacuum.

__Is it obvious that the gravitational acceleration is independent of all these quantities?__

By no means.

__Is it true?__

We think so, but it is not obvious and it cannot be proven from first principles.

> last lecture, Professor Lewin dropped an apple from 3 m and another one from 1.5 m.
> Based on the drop times, gravitational acceleration could be calculated.

Suppose I dropped an apple at time t = 0, call that position x\_0, with zero speed.

The general equations, now, which deal with gravity...is the following.

![x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} g t^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%20%3D%20x_0%20&plus;%20v_0%20t%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20g%20t%5E2)

and 

g = 9.80 m/s^2.

The velocity, at any moment in time equals 

![v_0 + g t](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?v_0%20&plus;%20g%20t) 

and the acceleration is constant--it's simply g.

Now, in my case, I have chosen at t = 0, x\_0 = 0, v\_0 = 0

![x = \frac{1}{2} gt^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20gt%5E2)

> ![g = \frac{2x}{t^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?g%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2x%7D%7Bt%5E2%7D)

> h1 = 3.000 &plusmn; 0.003 m; t1 = 0.781 &plusmn; 0.002 sec => g = 9.84 &plusmn; 0.06 m/s

> h2 = 1.500 &plusmn; 0.003 m; t2 = 0.551 &plusmn; 0.002 sec => g = 9.88 &plusmn; 0.09 m/s

Remember that we derived, last time, that the time it takes for the apple to fall was 

![C \sqrt{h \over g}](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20%5Csqrt%7Bh%20%5Cover%20g%7D)  

and we never knew what that C was.

Now you know, because now you have the equations here and you see that 

![C = \sqrt 2](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%202)

But I could not derive that from my dimensional analysis.

## Strobing an Object in Free Fall

Look at this situation, v = gt.

That means when I drop an apple--that the velocity increases with time.

So if I strobe this apple while it was falling I would see the separation to increase with time, because the velocity goes up with time.

I have here an apple that I am going to drop at a height of about 3 m from the floor--

We know from last time, that it took about 780 ms to hit the floor.

1. Strobe at 2 Hz
2. Strobe at 10 Hz
