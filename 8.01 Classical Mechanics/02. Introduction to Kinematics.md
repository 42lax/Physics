## Introduction to 1-Dimensional Motion

I have a motion of an object along a straight line--

We'll call that __one-dimensional motion__.

Diagram below shows the position of the object, x, at various points in time ( $ t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5 $ )

![1D motion of an object at various points in time][1]

Now we will introduce what we call the __average velocity__.

* I put a bar over it.
* That stands for average between time $ t_1 $ and time $ t_2 $.

$$ \bar{v}_{t_1 t_2} = {{x_{t_2} - x_{t_1}} \over {t_2 - t_1}} $$

* could be > 0 ($ t_1 $ -> $ t_2 $), = 0 ($ t_1 $ -> $ t_5 $), < 0 ($ t_2 $ -> $ t_4 $)
* choice of 0 on $x$-axis is unimportant
* choice of +ve direction of $x$-axis is important
* __the direction determines the signs__.
* __Signs in physics do matter.__

Diagram below is an $x$-$t$ diagram that shows exactly where the object is at any moment in time.

![x-t diagram of an object in 1D motion][2]

* choice of 0-point is unimportant but need it to make a graph

$$ \bar{v} = {\Delta x \over \Delta t} $$

* be careful about the sign convention
* sign of average velocity depends on the angle of the secant line

## Average Speed vs. Average Velocity

There is a very big difference in physics between speed and velocity.

$$ \text{average speed} = {\text{distance traveled} \over \text{time taken}} $$

__What is the distance that the object traveled between time $t_1$ and time $t_5$?__ 

* have to add up all the distances, irrespective to what direction the object is travelling

![average speed needs the distance travelled][3]

e.g. If the distance altogether were $300\ m$ and the time between $t_1$ and $t_5$ were $3\ s$, then the average speed would be $300\ m / 3\ s = 100\ m/s$. Yet yet the average velocity would be $0\ m/s$.

## Instantaneous Velocity

__The instantaneous velocity__, $v$, at time $t$ is defined to be 

$$ v_t = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x_{t+\Delta t} - x_t}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt} $$

* can be recognized as the first derivative of the position w.r.t. time

> $ v = \frac{dx}{dt} $

* can be either > 0, = 0, or < 0, depending on tangential angle
* look for velocity is zero where the derivative is zero

__What are the times that the velocity is positive?__

* look for positive slope

__What is the instantaneous speed?__

* speed is not sign-sensitive
* __the speed is the magnitude of the velocity__

e.g. the velocity of $-100\ m/s$ is lower than the velocity of $+30\ m/s$, but the speed is higher

## Measuring the Average Speed of a Bullet

__How can I measure the average speed of a bullet?__

* two parallel wires, seperated by $D$ meters
* bullet would break those wires
* when wire I breaks, timer starts
* when wire II breaks, timer stops

![Setup for measuring the average speed of a bullet][4]

> the wire are not exactly parallel, the wire may be deformed upon bullet impact before breaking
> Hence, the uncertainly in measuring $D$ would be higher

So the distance between the 2 wires, $D$, is measured to be 

$148.5 \pm 0.5\ cm$

> only about 5/1500 or 1/300 = 1/3% error (__relative error__)

I want to measure the accuracy of the speed of the bullet to about 2%.

__How accurate should I do the timing?__

Suppose the speed of the bullet is lower than the speed of sound, which is 340 m/s, say 300 m/s

Then it would take $5\ ms$ for this bullet to travel the distance between the wires.

And if I want to make a measurement to 2% accuracy, the timing error must be less than about $1/10\ ms$ because $1/10\ ms$ is about 2% of $5\ ms$.

The timing measurement is

$5.8 \pm 0.1\ ms$

And so this is the result.

$$ \frac{D}{t} = \frac{148.5 \pm 0.5 cm}{5.8 \pm 0.1 ms} = 256 \pm 4\ m/s$$

## Introducing Average Acceleration

The __average acceleration__ between time $t_1$ and time $t_2$ would be

$$ \bar{a}_{t_1 t_2} = \frac{v_{t_2} - v_{t_1}}{t_2 - t_1}\ m/s^2 $$

* this number can be > 0, = 0, < 0
* the sign depends on the direction of positive $x$-axis, not the zero point

You can also write down that average acceleration using the difference quotient but you must be careful about the sign convention.

$$\bar{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$

### Example:

I have here a tennis ball and I can bounce this tennis ball, I can throw it down.

Assume that it hits the floor at about $5\ m/s$, and it also bounces back with a velocity of about $5\ m/s$.

![Tennis ball bouncing off the floor][5]

__What is the average acceleration?__

I would have to know the time that it takes for this change in direction.

In other words, we call that the __impact time__.

Assume the impact time to be about $1/100\ s$

$$ \bar{a} = \frac{10}{10^2} = +10^3\ m/s^2 $$

### Example:

I have also here a tomato and I have here some eggs.

Now, imagine now that I throw the tomato or the egg down and that they hit the floor at $5\ m/s$. They would not come back up. Therefore, the change in velocity would  only be $5\ m/s$.

The impact time would probably be much longer, maybe a $1/4\ s$.

So therefore the average acceleration during the impact would only be 

$5 / (1/4) = 20\ m/s^2$.

> Sign convention matters for the calculation; but Physics does not change

__Something breaks because the magnitude of acceleration becomes too high.__

> Professor Lewin told a Sherlock Holmes story about a guy crushed his skull when fell on the floor

And when the impact time is short even if you hit the floor with a modest speed the acceleration is high...that was too much and so that's why his skull was crushed.

__What matters is this changing velocity and the impact time__.

## Instantaneous Acceleration

The acceleration at any moment in time will be 

$$ a_t = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{v_{t + \Delta t}}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} $$

That is the __instantaneous acceleration__.

And this, you will recognize is the __first derivative of velocity versus time__, which is also the __second derivative of position versus time__.

> Remember this

> $ a = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} $

We can go to our plot and ask:

__Where is the acceleration = 0, > 0, < 0?__ 

Look at how the slope is changing.

## Quadratic Equation of Position in Time

I'm going to give you the position $x$ as a function of time and then ask you lots of questions about it.

### Example:

$$ x = 8 - 6t + t^2\ m $$

__What is the velocity at any moment in time?__ 

Well, that's the derivative $ \frac{dx}{dt}$ and I will be using the differentiation rule for $ x = t^n $

Then, as most of you should know 

$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = n t^{n-1} $$

Then, I would get $ v = -6 + 2t\ m/s$

and the acceleration $a = +2\ m/s^2$

So notice that the acceleration is constant in time but the velocity is changing.

At time $t = 0$, $x$ is $+8$, the velocity is $-6\ m/s$ and the acceleration equals $+2$.

__At what time does $x = 0$?__

Solve the quadratic equation to get $t = +2$ or $t = +4$.

__When is the velocity zero?__ 

$t = 3$

__What is, at that moment, the position?__

Substitute $t = 3$ and that gives me $x = -1$.

So now I'm ready to plot $x$ as a function of $t$.

![Plot x-v diagram][6]

## 1D Motion with Constant Acceleration

I now would like to write down, in most general form the equation for the position and the velocity as a function of time for a one-dimensional motion whereby the acceleration is constant.

So it's going to be one-dimensional again and the acceleration, $a$, is going to be a constant.

So we're going to get 

$$ x = C_1 + C_2 t + C_3 t^2 $$

I can now take the derivative and so I get 

$$ v = C_2  + 2 C_3 t $$

and

$$ a= 2 C_3 $$

Clearly, $C_1$ is the position of $x$ at time $t = 0$

$$ C_1 = x_0 $$

$C_2$ is really the velocity at time $t = 0$

$$ C_2 = v_0 $$

And the acceleration is not changing with time. It's $2C_3$.

Therefore,

$$ C_3 = \frac{1}{2} a $$

When an object is influenced by the gravitational acceleration and the gravitational acceleration is a constant.

And we write, often for that gravitational acceleration, the letter "$g$".

In Boston, $g$ is $9.80\ m/s^2$ and it varies a little bit for different places on Earth.

$$ g = 9.80\  m/s^2$$

This gravitational acceleration is independent 

* of the mass of the object that I drop, 
* of the speed of the object,
* of the chemical composition of the object,
* of the size of the object and 
* of the shape of the object

assuming that we have no air drag, that these experiments are done in...in vacuum.

__Is it obvious that the gravitational acceleration is independent of all these quantities?__

By no means.

__Is it true?__

We think so, but it is not obvious and it cannot be proven from first principles.

> last lecture, Professor Lewin dropped an apple from $3\ m$ and another one from $1.5\ m$.
> Based on the drop times, gravitational acceleration could be calculated.

Suppose I dropped an apple at time $t = 0$, call that position $x_0$, with zero speed.

The general equations, now, which deal with gravity...is the following.

$$ x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2 $$ 

and 

$$ g = 9.80\ m/s^2$$

The velocity, at any moment in time equals $ v_0 + g t $ and the acceleration is constant. It's simply $g$.

Now, in my case, I have chosen at $t = 0$, $x_0 = 0$, $v_0 = 0$

$$ x = \frac{1}{2} gt^2 $$

> $ g = \frac{2x}{t^2} $<br>
> $ h_1 = 3.000 \pm 0.003\ m $; $ t_1 = 0.781 \pm 0.002\ s $ => $ g = 9.84 \pm 0.06\ m/s$<br>
> $ h_2 = 1.500 \pm 0.003\ m $; $ t_2 = 0.551 \pm 0.002\ s $ => $ g = 9.88 \pm 0.09\ m/s$

Remember that we derived, last time, that the time it takes for the apple to fall was 

$$ C \sqrt{h \over g} $$

and we never knew what that $C$ was.

Now you know, because now you have the equations here and you see that 

$$ C = \sqrt 2 $$

But I could not derive that from my dimensional analysis.

## Strobing an Object in Free Fall

Look at this situation, $v = gt$.

That means when I drop an apple--that the velocity increases with time.

So if I strobe this apple while it was falling I would see the separation to increase with time, because the velocity goes up with time.

I have here an apple that I am going to drop at a height of about $3\ m$ from the floor--

We know from last time, that it took about $780\ ms$ to hit the floor.

1. Strobe at $2\ Hz$
2. Strobe at $10\ Hz$
