## Normal and Frictional Forces

![Object on a horizontal surface][1]

Forces on the object

* gravitational force, mg
* __normal force__, N = mg
* force by Walter Lewin

The object is not accelerating in x-diretion at first, so there must be a frictional force to counter the force given by Walter Lewin.

As Professor Lewin pushes harder, the frictional force would also increase until it reaches a reaches a maximum value which it cannot exceed.

Experimental fact:

![F_{f, max} = \mu \cdot N](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_%7Bf%2C%20max%7D%20%3D%20%5Cmu%20%5Ccdot%20N)

where ![\mu](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu) is called __the  friction coefficient__, and has no dimension

Distinction between __static__ friction coefficients and __kinetic__ friction
coefficient.

* static: to break it loose, to get it going
* kinetic: to keep it going when it already has a certain velocity

* ![\mu_s > \mu_k](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu_s%20%3E%20%5Cmu_k)

## Measurements of the Coefficient of Static Friction

It is fairly easy to measure a friction coefficient by putting an object on an incline and by changing the angle of the incline, increasing it.

![Object on an incline][2]

Forces on the object:

* gravity, mg

	* x-direction: ![mg \sin \alpha](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha)
	* y-direction: ![mg \cdot \cos \alpha](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20%5Ccos%20%5Calpha)

* normal force: ![N = mg \cos \alpha](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N%20%3D%20mg%20%5Ccos%20%5Calpha)

* friction: ![F_f = \mu_s \cdot N](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_f%20%3D%20%5Cmu_s%20%5Ccdot%20N)

As the tilt is increased, the frictional force would eventually reach its maximum value, and the object will start to slide down.

![mg \sin \alpha - F_f = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20-%20F_f%20%3D%200)

![mg \sin \alpha - \mu_s N = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20-%20%5Cmu_s%20N%20%3D%200)

![mg \sin \alpha - \mu_s mg \cos \alpha = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20-%20%5Cmu_s%20mg%20%5Ccos%20%5Calpha%20%3D%200)

![\mu_s = \tan \alpha](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu_s%20%3D%20%5Ctan%20%5Calpha)

The friction coefficient is

* independent of the mass.
* independent of the contact surface area
* only depends on the materials

e.g. park a car with the brakes on, since the friction coefficient for rubber on concrete is about 1, so the car would slide on the hill of 45 degree.

### Demo: various objects on an incline

* plastic bin vs rubber puck
* mass independence
* surface area independent

The width of the tires of your car does not matter.

But __why race cars have very wide tires?__

## Another Way to Measure Friction

![Object on an incline with a pulley][3]

Problem:

* do not know in which direction the system will accelerate or whether it will not accelerate at all--

All these three cases have to be dealt with independently.

1. about to accelerate uphill

	![T - m_1 g \sin \alpha - F_{f,max} = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20-%20m_1%20g%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20-%20F_%7Bf%2Cmax%7D%20%3D%200)

	![m_2 g = m_1 g \sin \alpha + F_{f,max}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_2%20g%20%3D%20m_1%20g%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20&plus;%20F_%7Bf%2Cmax%7D)

2. about to accelerate downhill

	![T + F_{f,max} - m_1 g \sin \alpha = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20&plus;%20F_%7Bf%2Cmax%7D%20-%20m_1%20g%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20%3D%200)

	![m_2 g = m_1 g \sin \alpha - F_{f,max}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_2%20g%20%3D%20m_1%20g%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20-%20F_%7Bf%2Cmax%7D)

3. neight 1 or 2:

	* friction would adjust itself to balance out the force in x-direction

### Example:

* m1 = 1 kg, m2 = 2 kg
* ![\alpha = 30^\circ](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha%20%3D%2030%5E%5Ccirc)
* ![\mu_s = 0.5, \mu_k = 0.4](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu_s%20%3D%200.5%2C%20%5Cmu_k%20%3D%200.4)

Is it going to be accelerated uphill or accelerated downhill or no acceleration at all? 

* ![m_2 g = 20](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_2%20g%20%3D%2020)
* ![m_1 g \sin \alpha = 5](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1%20g%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20%3D%205)
* ![F_{f,max} = \mu_s m_1 g \cos \alpha = 4.33](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_%7Bf%2Cmax%7D%20%3D%20%5Cmu_s%20m_1%20g%20%5Ccos%20%5Calpha%20%3D%204.33)

Let's first test whether condition one is met.

20 > 5 + 4.33? 

And the answer is yes, it is.

So we know that it's going to be accelerated uphill.

__What is the acceleration and what is the tension in the string?__

* need to change ![F_{f,max} = \mu_k m_1 g \cos \alpha](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_%7Bf%2Cmax%7D%20%3D%20%5Cmu_k%20m_1%20g%20%5Ccos%20%5Calpha) since it is now moving

![T - m_1 g \sin \alpha - \mu_k m_1 g \cos \alpha = m_1 a](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20-%20m_1%20g%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20-%20%5Cmu_k%20m_1%20g%20%5Ccos%20%5Calpha%20%3D%20m_1%20a)

![m_2 g - T = m_2 a](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_2%20g%20-%20T%20%3D%20m_2%20a)

Solve to get.

* a = 3.85 m/s^2
* T = 12.3 N

### Example:

* m1 = 1 kg, m2 = 0.4 kg
* ![\alpha = 30^\circ](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha%20%3D%2030%5E%5Ccirc)
* ![\mu_s = 0.5, \mu_k = 0.4](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu_s%20%3D%200.5%2C%20%5Cmu_k%20%3D%200.4)

* ![m_2 g = 4](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_2%20g%20%3D%204)

Now, test the conditions

1. 4 > 5 + 4.33? NO
2. 4 < 5 - 4.33? NO

Conclusion:

a = 0

The object will not be accelerated and the frictional force is going to adjust along the x direction so that the acceleration indeed is zero.

__How does the frictional force do that?__ 

* ![m_1 g \sin \alpha = 5](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1%20g%20%5Csin%20%5Calpha%20%3D%205)
* ![T = m_2 g = 4](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%20m_2%20g%20%3D%204)

Five newtons downhill, four newtons uphill.

__What will the friction be?__

Uphill, 1 N.

### Demo: measure coefficient of friction

__Experiment 1: Slide down an incline__

* m = ![361 \pm 1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?361%20%5Cpm%201) g
* ![\alpha = 20](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha%20%3D%2020)

> ![\mu_s = \tan 20^\circ = 0.364](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmu_s%20%3D%20%5Ctan%2020%5E%5Ccirc%20%3D%200.364)

__Experiment 2: Slide up an incline with a pulley__

* ![\alpha = 20](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Calpha%20%3D%2020)
* ![m_2 = 270 \pm 25](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_2%20%3D%20270%20%5Cpm%2025) g

__Would you find exactly the same number in these two experiments?__

Not very likely.

Wood has grain, and the grain could not be the same in every direction.

__What happened during experiment #2?__

* at first, it wants to slide downhill. So the friction is uphill
* as m2 is increased, the friction becomes less and less
* There comes a time that the friction becomes zero.
* as m2 is further increased, the friction flips direction to downhill
* as m2 is again increased, the friction is also increased until its maximum value
* Then, the box starts to slide uphill

## Ways to Reduce Friction - Fleas are Good for Something!

Friction is often a pain in the neck
* friction causes wear and tear
* friction costs fuel.

With a car, there's a lot of friction with the road.

People try to reduce friction
* with bearings 
* with lubrication (e.g. oil, water)

e.g. early part of the rain, the water is mixed with a little of dust

e.g. cover of a pan becomes frictionless as water accumulated around the rim

e.g. hovercrafts

e.g. air track

![air track][4]

e.g. a container of dry ice...

* shows a film to demonstrate even a flea can pull the container if there is no friction
