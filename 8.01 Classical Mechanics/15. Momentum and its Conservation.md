## Conservation of Momentum

In physics, momentum is a vector

![\vec{p} = m\vec{v}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7Bp%7D%20%3D%20m%5Cvec%7Bv%7D) kg m/s

![\vec{F} = m\vec{a} = m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{d(m\vec{v})}{dt} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%3D%20m%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20%3D%20m%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bv%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%28m%5Cvec%7Bv%7D%29%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bp%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D)

So you see--the force is dp/dt, and that means __if a particle changes its momentum, a force must have acted upon it__.

It also means __if a force acts on a particle, it will change its momentum__.

Let us now envision that we have a whole set of particles which are interacting with each other.

![System of particles with external forces][1]

I pick one here, call it m<sub>i</sub>, and I pick another here, call it m<sub>j</sub>.

And there is an external force on them, and so on m<sub>i</sub>, there is a force F<sub>i,external</sub>, and on m<sub>j</sub>, there is F<sub>j,external</sub>.

But they're interacting with each other

So there would be internal forces between each pair of particles, and they obey Newton's Third Law.

The net force is ultimately the sum of the external force and all the internal forces.

__What is the total momentum of these zillions of particles?__

Well, that's the sum of the individual momenta.

![\vec{p}_{total} = \vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2 + ... + \vec{p}_i + ...](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7Bp%7D_%7Btotal%7D%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7Bp%7D_1%20&plus;%20%5Cvec%7Bp%7D_2%20&plus;%20...%20&plus;%20%5Cvec%7Bp%7D_i%20&plus;%20...)

I take the derivative of this-- 

![\frac{d\vec{p}_{total}}{dt} = \vec{F}_{1,net} + \vec{F}_{2,net} + ... + \vec{F}_{i,net} + ...](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bp%7D_%7Btotal%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7B1%2Cnet%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7B2%2Cnet%7D%20&plus;%20...%20&plus;%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7Bi%2Cnet%7D%20&plus;%20...)

And when we add up all these forces, obviously that is the total force on the entire system.

If we view the system as a whole, the internal forces cancel each other out.

Therefore, 

![\frac{d\vec{p}_{total}}{dt} = \vec{F}_{net,external}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bd%5Cvec%7Bp%7D_%7Btotal%7D%7D%7Bdt%7D%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7Bnet%2Cexternal%7D)

This means that if the net external force on the whole system is zero, the momentum cannot change.

Momentum is conserved, and that's called __the conservation of momentum__.

## Kinetic Energy and Momentum for a 1D Collision

![1D tail collision][2]

And so now I can apply the conservation of momentum.

The momentum before must be the same as the momentum afterwards because there are no external forces on the system.

![m_1\vec{v}_1 + m_2\vec{v}_2 = (m1+m2)\vec{v'}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_1%20&plus;%20m_2%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_2%20%3D%20%28m1&plus;m2%29%5Cvec%7Bv%27%7D)

And suppose m<sub>1</sub> = 1 kg, and v<sub>1</sub> = 5 m/s

Let m<sub>2</sub> = 2 kg, and v<sub>2</sub> = 3 m/s.

And you see, since they are both in the same direction,

5 + 6 = 3 v'

so v' = 11/3 m/s.

So the conservation of momentum tells you what the speed is after the collision.

When we deal with collisions, __the velocities of the objects before the collision are unprimed__. __The velocities after the collisions, by convention, are primed__.

Now if after the collision, object 1 and object 2 have different velocities, we will call them v<sub>1</sub>' and v<sub>2</sub>'.

With an inelastic collision, m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> are stuck together.

Now, there was a certain amount of kinetic energy before the collision, and of course, we can all calculate that-- kinetic energy before the collision.

![\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_1%20v_1%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_2%20v_2%5E2)

__How much is it?__

If you add that up, you will find 21.5 J.

__What is the kinetic energy after the collision?__

![\frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) {v'}^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%28m_1%20&plus;%20m_2%29%20%7Bv%27%7D%5E2)

That would give us 20.2 J.

So the kinetic energy went down.

Now, change the situation to a head-on collision.

__What is the momentum of particle number one?__

Well, that is m<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> = 5.

__What is the momentum of particle number two?__

Well, that is m<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub> = -6.

__What is the total momentum?__

-1 kg m/s

__What now is v'?__

(m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>)v' = -1

and so v' = -1/3 m/s.

The kinetic energy before has not changed--still is 21.5 J.

__What now is the kinetic energy afterwards?__

Now, there is only 0.17 J left.

Almost all kinetic energy has been destroyed.

So kinetic energy can be destroyed, but momentum cannot be destroyed in the absence of external forces.

Suppose we have another head-on collision

* particle one has a mass 5; the velocity is 1
* particle two has a mass 1; the velocity is 5
* total momentum before and after is 0
* total kinetic energy before is 15
* total kinetic energy after is 0

## Energy and Momentum for a 2D Car Collision

If you have a car collision, and two cars hit each other, and I compare the situation just before the collision with just after the collision-- 

The impact time is so short that the change in momentum due to friction with the road--that would be an external force--can be ignored.

So momentum is approximately conserved if we can ignore the friction from the road during the impact time.

![2D Car Collision][3]

__In what direction and what will be the speed after the collision?__

Well, the net momentum is the vectorial sum of the momemtum of the two cars. That is never going to change before and after the collision.

And therefore if you knew the angle of incidents, p<sub>1</sub> and p<sub>2</sub>, then you can calculate in what direction the objects are going to slide, and also the velocity after the impact.

And that's what the police is doing when they find wrecks on the road.

They actually use the skidding tracks of the wreck to calculate v', and then they can try to reconstruct the situation as it was before the collision.

We've only considered cases where they stick together, in which case we call them "__completely inelastic collisions__."

__In completely inelastic collisions, you always lose kinetic energy__

## Scenarios that Increase the Kinetic Energy

__Can we have, in a collision, an increase of kinetic energy?__

Yes.

e.g. exploding block

![Exploding block][4]

Clearly, momentum must be conserved.

__What happened with the kinetic energy?__

Well, kinetic energy has clearly increased.

__Where did the kinetric energy come from?__

Well, it was from the chemical reaction of the explosion.

__Never confuse momentum with energy.__

### Demo: 

* Set up on air track so there is a minimum of friction.
* push two cars together and hold them together with a spring
* they are held together with a string
* take a burner and burn away this thread

__How do we measure the speed?__

Well, we actually measure the time for the cars to move 10 cm.

Each car has a 10-cm long metal plate and it blanks out a light-emitting diode.

And the moment that the LED is occluded, the timer starts, and the moment that the LED emerges again, the timer stops.

__Experiment 1:__

1. m<sub>1</sub> = 244 &plusmn; 1 g
2. m<sub>2</sub> = 244 &plusmn; 1 g

Prediction:

I would predict that the times of these two cars will be the same to within roughly 5%.

Observation:

1. t<sub>1</sub> = 0.219 &plusmn; 0.001 s
2. t<sub>2</sub> = 0.223 &plusmn; 0.001 s

__Experiment 2:__

1. m<sub>1</sub> = 488 &plusmn; 1 g
2. m<sub>2</sub> = 244 &plusmn; 1 g

Prediction:

t<sub>2</sub> should be 2 x t<sub>1</sub> to within 5% of uncertainty.

Observation:

1. t<sub>1</sub> = 0.406 &plusmn; 0.001 s
2. t<sub>2</sub> = 0.193 &plusmn; 0.001 s

## Center of Mass of a System

The center of mass of a system is defined as follows:

![Center of mass][5]

![M_{total} \vec{r}_{cm} = \sum_i m_i \vec{r}_i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?M_%7Btotal%7D%20%5Cvec%7Br%7D_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_i%20m_i%20%5Cvec%7Br%7D_i)

Take the derivative of this equation, we have

![M_{total} \vec{v}_{cm} = \sum_i m_i \vec{v}_i](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?M_%7Btotal%7D%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_i%20m_i%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_i)

So, we have

![\vec{p}_{total} = M_{total} \vec{v}_{cm}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7Bp%7D_%7Btotal%7D%20%3D%20M_%7Btotal%7D%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_%7Bcm%7D)

And so now you come to another very important statement in physics, and that is __the total momentum of an object is the total mass of that object times the velocity of the center of mass__.

And if I take the derivative of this, then 

![\vec{F}_{net,external} = M_{total} \vec{a}_{cm}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7Bnet%2Cexternal%7D%20%3D%20M_%7Btotal%7D%20%5Cvec%7Ba%7D_%7Bcm%7D)

This says F = ma.

The center of mass behaves as if all the mass of the entire object was right at that center of mass.

For the center of mass, the total momentum is the total mass times the velocity of the center of mass.

And you take the derivative of that equation and you get F = ma.

### Example

![3 mass system][6]

Where is the center of mass?

We break it up into components.

For the x component, we have

![4mx_{cm} = m \cdot 0 + m \cdot \frac{l}{2} + 2m \cdot l](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?4mx_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20m%20%5Ccdot%200%20&plus;%20m%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cfrac%7Bl%7D%7B2%7D%20&plus;%202m%20%5Ccdot%20l)

![x_{cm} = \frac{5}{8} l](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B8%7D%20l)

Now, in the y direction, do the same thing would obtain

![y_{cm} = \frac{\sqrt 3}{8} l](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csqrt%203%7D%7B8%7D%20l)

And so you have calculated the center of mass.

### Demo: Uniform motion of the center of the mass

* connect two cars with springs
* slide them across the air track
* center of mass will travel in a constant speed
* while the two cars would oscillate in a weird way

### Demo: Uniform motion of the center of the mass of a squash racquet

* attach the center of the mass with a UV dot
* throw the racquet at an angle
* the center of the mass traverses a path of parabola
