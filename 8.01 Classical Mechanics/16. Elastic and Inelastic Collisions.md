## 1D Elastic Collisions

Today I will talk about collisions in more general terms.

Let's take a one-dimensional case.

![1D Elastic Collision][1]

* 2 masses, m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>
* Before: v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub> = 0
* After: v<sub>1</sub>', v<sub>2</sub>'

To find v<sub>1</sub>' and v<sub>2</sub>', we need two equations.

If no net external force is on the system during the collisions, then momentum is conserved.

![m_1 v_1 = m_1 v_1' + m_2 v_2'](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1%20v_1%20%3D%20m_1%20v_1%27%20&plus;%20m_2%20v_2%27)

Now, we need a second equation.

Now, in physics we believe very strongly in the conservation of energy, not necessarily in the conservation of kinetic energy.

We believe that if you destroy energy, it must come out in some other form, and you cannot create energy out of nothing.

In the case of the completely inelastic collisions, we lost kinetic energy, which was converted to heat.

There was internal friction.

When the car wreck plowed into each other, there was internal friction--no external friction--and that took out kinetic energy.

And so, in its most general form, you can write down that 

![K + Q = K'](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K%20&plus;%20Q%20%3D%20K%27)

If you know Q, then you have a second equation, and then you can solve for v<sub>1</sub>' and for v<sub>2</sub>'.

* Q > 0, gained kinetic energy, called __superelastic collision__
* Q = 0, conserved kinetic energy, called __(completely) elastic collision__
* Q < 0, lost kinetic energy, called __completely inelastic collision__

Now I want to continue a case whereby I have a completely elastic collision. So Q = 0.

Momentum is conserved, because there was no net external force, but now kinetic energy is also conserved.

And so I can write down now 

![\frac{1}{2} m_1v_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1v_1'^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2v_2'^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_1v_1%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_1v_1%27%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_2v_2%27%5E2)

Solving these two equations, we would get

![v_1' = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}v_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_1%27%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_1%20-%20m_2%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7Dv_1)

and 

![v_2' = \frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2}v_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_2%27%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2m_1%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7Dv_1)

This is the result which holds under three conditions: 

1. kinetic energy is conserved, so Q = 0
2. momentum is conserved
3. v<sub>2</sub> before the collision equals zero.

Let's look at 3 interesting cases whereby we go to extremes.

1. m<sub>1</sub> >> m<sub>2</sub>

	![v_1' = v_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_1%27%20%3D%20v_1)

	![v_2' = 2v_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_2%27%20%3D%202v_1)

2. m<sub>1</sub> << m<sub>2</sub>

	![v_1' = -v_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_1%27%20%3D%20-v_1)

	![v_2' = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_2%27%20%3D%200)

3. m<sub>1</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>

	![v_1' = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_1%27%20%3D%200)

	![v_2' = v_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_2%27%20%3D%20v_1)	

	e.g. Newton's cradle

### Demo: Billiard ball vs. Ping-pong ball

* Billard ball and ping-pong ball suspended as pendulumns
* mass ratio is 500:1

1. Swing ping-pong ball onto billiard ball
2. Swing billiard ball onto ping-pong ball

### Demo: Elastic collision on air track

* object m<sub>1</sub> banged against object m<sub>2</sub>
* object m<sub>2</sub> stands still initially
* using springs to make the collision ellastic

#### Experiment 1:

* m<sub>1</sub> = 241 &plusmn; 1 g
* m<sub>2</sub> = 241 &plusmn; 1 g

Prediction:

* v<sub>1</sub>' = 0
* v<sub>2</sub>' = v<sub>1</sub>

Observation:

* t<sub>1</sub>  = 0.194
* t<sub>1</sub>' = 0.000
* t<sub>2</sub>' = 0.196

#### Experiment 2:

* m<sub>1</sub> = 241 &plusmn; 1 g
* m<sub>2</sub> = 482 &plusmn; 1 g

Prediction:

* v<sub>1</sub>' = -1/3 v<sub>1</sub>
* v<sub>2</sub>' = +2/3 v<sub>1</sub>

Observation:

* t<sub>1</sub>  = 0.123
* t<sub>1</sub>' = 0.375 * (1/3) = 0.125
* t<sub>2</sub>' = 0.186 * (2/3) = 0.124

## Brain Teaser - Elastic Collision with a Wall

![Tennis ball bounced off a wall][2]

* elastic collision => kinetic energy is conserved, entirely in the tennis ball
* the momentum of this tennis ball has changed by an amount 2 mv
* that momentum must be in the wall--because momentum must be conserved

__How can the wall have no kinetic energy yet acquired momentum?__

## Center of Mass (CM) Frame of Reference

In the absence of any net external forces on a system as a whole, the center of mass will always have the same velocity.

If you jump into the frame of the center of mass, which means you move with the same velocity as the center of mass, the center of mass stands still in your frame of reference.

And if the center of mass stands still, the momentum of the particles in this frame of reference, is zero.

![Collision in the center-of-mass frame][3]

![m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = 0 = m_1 u_1' + m_2 u_2'](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1%20u_1%20&plus;%20m_2%20u_2%20%3D%200%20%3D%20m_1%20u_1%27%20&plus;%20m_2%20u_2%27)

Q is zero--and so kinetic energy must be conserved.

![\frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1'^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 u_2'^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_1%20u_1%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_2%20u_2%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_1%20u_1%27%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_2%20u_2%27%5E2)

The result in the center of mass is that 

![u_1' = -u_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?u_1%27%20%3D%20-u_1)

and 

![u_2' = -u_2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?u_2%27%20%3D%20-u_2)

In the center of mass, all that happens is that velocities reverse directions, but the speeds remain the same.

__How do we calculate the velocity of the center of mass?__

First, move back to laboratory frame.

![M_{total} \vec{r}_{cm} = m_1 \vec{r}_1 + m_2 \vec{r}_2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?M_%7Btotal%7D%20%5Cvec%7Br%7D_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20m_1%20%5Cvec%7Br%7D_1%20&plus;%20m_2%20%5Cvec%7Br%7D_2)

If you take the derivative of this equation, then 

![v_{cm} = \frac{m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2}{m_1 + m_2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_1%20v_1%20&plus;%20m_2%20v_2%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7D)

Now, if you want to know what the velocity is in the center-of-mass frame, 

![\vec{u}_1 = \vec{v}_1 - \vec{v}_{cm}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7Bu%7D_1%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_1%20-%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_%7Bcm%7D)

![\vec{u}_2 = \vec{v}_2 - \vec{v}_{cm}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7Bu%7D_2%20%3D%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_2%20-%20%5Cvec%7Bv%7D_%7Bcm%7D)

It sometimes pays off to move into the center-of-mass frame.

The momentum in the center-of-mass frame is always zero before and after the collision, independent of whether it is an elastic, an inelastic, or a superelastic collision.

## 1D Inelastic Collision and Internal Energy

The kinetic energy and the momentum depend on your reference frame.

In general, the total momentum as seen from the lab frame is not zero.

In the case of the center of mass, the total momentum is always zero.

In general, the kinetic energy as seen from the lab frame is not the same as the kinetic energy from the center-of-mass frame.

If I have a completely inelastic collision, then all energy in the center-of-mass frame is lost.

This lost in kinetic energy--as observed in the center-of-mass frame--is called the internal energy. 

That would be the maximum energy in a collision that can ever be converted into heat.

### Example: 

![Completely inelastic collision][4]

Momentum is conserved if there's no net external force on the system, and so I can write down that 

![m_1 v_1 = (m_1 + m_2) v'](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1%20v_1%20%3D%20%28m_1%20&plus;%20m_2%29%20v%27)

And so 

![v' = \frac{m_1 v_1}{m_1 + m_2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v%27%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_1%20v_1%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7D)

This is also the velocity of the center of mass.

Now we can calculate what the difference is between the kinetic energies after and before the collision.

This equals 

![K' - K = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}v_1^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K%27%20-%20K%20%3D%20-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cfrac%7Bm_1%20m_2%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7Dv_1%5E2)

We lose kinetic energy when there is a completely inelastic collision.

This is Q. You lose kinetic energy and that goes into heat.

Now I'm going to do the same calculation in the center-of-mass frame.

![u_1 = v_1 - v_{cm} = \frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} v_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?u_1%20%3D%20v_1%20-%20v_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_2%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7D%20v_1)

![u_2 = 0 - v_{cm} = - \frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} v_1](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?u_2%20%3D%200%20-%20v_%7Bcm%7D%20%3D%20-%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_1%7D%7Bm_1%20&plus;%20m_2%7D%20v_1)

Now we are going to calculate the kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame.

![K = \frac{1}{2} m_1 u_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 u_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)} v_1^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_1%20u_1%5E2%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_2%20u_2%5E2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Bm_1%20m_2%7D%7B%28m_1%20&plus;%20m_2%29%7D%20v_1%5E2)

That's all we have before the collision occurs.

This is the maximum you can ever lose, and this is what we call the internal kinetic energy of the system.

And so going to the center-of-mass system, you can always immediately calculate what the maximum heat is that you can expect from a collision.

### Special case:

If we take m2 going to &infin;, like slam a piece of putty onto the wall.

![K = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20m_1%20v_1%5E2)
