## Resistive and Drag Forces

When you move an object through a medium, whether it's a gas or whether it's a liquid, it experiences a __drag force__.

This drag force depends on 

* the shape of the object
* the size of the object
* the medium through which you move it
* the speed of the object.

The medium is immediately obvious.

For example,

* If you move through air, you feel the wind through your hair--
* If you swim in water, you feel this drag force.
* In oil, the drag force would be even larger.

__This drag force, this resistive force is very, very different from the frictional force__.

* the kinetic friction coefficient remains constant independent of the speed
* the drag forces and the resistive forces are not independent of the speed

In very general terms, 

![\vec{F}_{res} = -(k_1 v + k_2 v^2) \hat{v}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7Bres%7D%20%3D%20-%28k_1%20v%20&plus;%20k_2%20v%5E2%29%20%5Chat%7Bv%7D)

For spheres, we're going to get that 

![| F_{res} | = C_1 rv + C_2 r^2 v^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7C%20F_%7Bres%7D%20%7C%20%3D%20C_1%20rv%20&plus;%20C_2%20r%5E2%20v%5E2)

C1 is km / m / s and C2 has the dimension of density, kg / m^3

We call the first term the __viscous__ term, and the second term the __pressure__ term.

The viscous term has to do with the stickiness of the medium.

Physicists also refer to that as __viscosity__.

The C1 is a strong function of temperature.

e.g. heated tar is less sticky than when it is cold

C2 is not very dependent on the temperature.

It's not so easy to see why this pressure term here has a v^2.

> it has something to do with transfer of momentum

But the r^2 is very easy to see, because the sphere has a cross-sectional area which is proportional to r^2.

Two liquids with the very same density could have very different values for C1. They could differ by 4 or 5 orders of magnitude.

But if they have the same density, then the C2 is very much the same.

C2 is almost the density rho of the liquid--not quite but almost--
there is a very strong correlation between the C2 and the density.

If I drop an object and I just let it go--

as it picks up speed, the resistive force will grow, and there comes a time that the resistive force and the gravitational force are equal.

And when the two are equal, then there is no longer acceleration, so the object has a constant speed, and we call that the __terminal velocity__, and that will be the case when 

![mg = C_1 rv + C_2 r^2 v^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20%3D%20C_1%20rv%20&plus;%20C_2%20r%5E2%20v%5E2)

If you know what m is, the radius, and the values for C1 or C2 of that medium in which you move it, then you can calculate what the terminal velocity is.

## Two Regimes and the Critical Velocity

* Regime I:  the viscous term is dominating
* Regime II: the pressure term is dominating

When the viscous force and the pressure force are the same, 

![C_1 rv = C_2 r^2 v^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C_1%20rv%20%3D%20C_2%20r%5E2%20v%5E2)

We call that velocity __the critical velocity__, even though there is nothing critical about it.

And that, of course, 

![v_{crit} = \frac{C_1}{C_2 r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_%7Bcrit%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BC_1%7D%7BC_2%20r%7D)

Now we're going to make a clear distinction between the regimes I and II.

Regime I:

![v << v_{crit}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v%20%3C%3C%20v_%7Bcrit%7D)

So we then have that 

![mg = C_1 r v_{term}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20%3D%20C_1%20r%20v_%7Bterm%7D), 

and therefore 

![v_{term} = \frac{mg}{C_1 r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_%7Bterm%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bmg%7D%7BC_1%20r%7D)

If you take objects of the same material (same density), the density of the objects that you drop in the liquid or that you drop in the gas--

so that 

![m = \frac{4}{3} \pi \rho r^3](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B3%7D%20%5Cpi%20%5Crho%20r%5E3)

this rho is the density of the object; not the density of the medium--

then you can immediately see, since you get an r^3 here, that the terminal velocity is proportional to r^2 if you drop objects in there with the same density.

Regime II:

![v >> v_{crit}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v%20%3E%3E%20v_%7Bcrit%7D)

so then 

![mg = C_2 r^2 v_{term}^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?mg%20%3D%20C_2%20r%5E2%20v_%7Bterm%7D%5E2)

So the terminal velocity is then 

![v_{term} = \sqrt{\frac{mg}{C_2 r^2}}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_%7Bterm%7D%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Bmg%7D%7BC_2%20r%5E2%7D%7D)

And if you take objects with the same density and you compare their radii, m is proportional to r^3 so the terminal velocity is now proportional to the square root of r.

## Measurements with Steel Balls in Syrup

* drop ball bearings in Karo light corn syrup
* C_1 = 1.6 x 10^2 (kg/m)/sec (strongly temperature dependent)
* C_2 = 1.2 x 10^3 kg/m^3
* rho_syrup = 1.7 x 10^3 kg/m^3
* rho_ball  = 7.8 x 10^3 kg/m^3

And I'm going to drop in that Karo syrup four ball bearings, and they have diameters of an 1/8, 5/32, 3/16 and 1/4 of an inch.

And what I calculated was the terminal velocity as a function of radius of these ball bearings.

![Drop Steel Ball Bearings in Corn Syrup][1]

Our ball bearings are exclusively operating in regime I where the viscous term dominates.

Now you could say, "Well, what is the meaning of this critical speed here if they never reach that speed anyhow?" 

Well, this critical speed for a small ball bearing would be some 100 m/s.

That's about 200 mi/hr.

There is nothing wrong with injecting a ball bearing with 400 mi/hr into this syrup, in which case, you would be above the critical speed and so for a short while would the motion be controlled by the pressure term.

But of course when gravity takes over, then you ultimately end up in regime I.

Now we are going to look at the various ball bearings, the various sizes, and I'll show you how we do the experiment.

* there are seven marks which are 1 cm apart
* when it reaches the second mark, I will start my timer.
* when it reaches the sixth mark, I will stop my timer
* this journey is about 4 cm

And we will measure the time that it takes to go from here to here.

![t = \frac{h}{v_{term}} \propto \frac{1}{r^2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bh%7D%7Bv_%7Bterm%7D%7D%20%5Cpropto%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Br%5E2%7D)

So we're going to get a list here of the diameters of the ball bearings, and the diameters is in inches.

	<td>8</td>
	<td>1.56</td>
	<td>1.66 (1.40) &plusmn; 0.2 sec</td>

</table>

If the measurements were done correctly and if we really work in regime I, then if I plot 100 / d^2 versus t on linear paper, then it should be a straight line.

Now... is this a straight line or is it not? A gorgeous straight line.

And so you see you are really working here in the regime where the terminal velocity is proportional to the radius squared.

## Reaching Terminal Velocity in the Blink of an Eye

How long does it take for the terminal speed to be reached?

![ma = mg - C_1 r v](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ma%20%3D%20mg%20-%20C_1%20r%20v)

Let a = dv/dt, then I have here a differential equation in v

![\dot{v} + \frac{C_1 r}{m} v = g](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdot%7Bv%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7BC_1%20r%7D%7Bm%7D%20v%20%3D%20g)

What you're going to see is that the speed as a function of time is going to build up to a maximum value...

![Build up of terminal speed][2]

__How long does it take to reach a speed of about 99% of the terminal speed
for the 1/4" ball bearing?__

That is only 9 ms.

In other words, once it has broken through the surface--then in 9 ms will I already be at 99% of the terminal speed, and so there was no problem at all; when I waited for the object to cross the first mark, it was already clearly going at the terminal speed.

## Air Drag and the Pressure Term

If we take air at 1 atm, and we take it at room temperature, then 

![C_1 = 3.1 \times 10^{-4}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C_1%20%3D%203.1%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-4%7D)

and C_2 is about 0.85.

And so the critical speed, 

![v_{crit} = \frac{C_1}{C_2 r} \approx \frac{3.7 \times 10^{-4}}{r}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?v_%7Bcrit%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BC_1%7D%7BC_2%20r%7D%20%5Capprox%20%5Cfrac%7B3.7%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E%7B-4%7D%7D%7Br%7D) m/s

And that is about 400 times lower than the critical speed in the Karo syrup for the same value of r.

So if I drop the 1/4" ball bearing in the Karo syrup, then the terminal velocity is way below the critical velocity of the Karo syrup.

The critical velocity of the Karo syrup would be 100 mi/hr for a 1/4" ball bearing.

Here, in air, the critical velocity is something like 11 cm/s.

We know when you drop a 1/4" ball bearing in air that the speed is way larger, and therefore in the case of air, a 1/4" ball bearing would have a speed way above the critical speed, and so you are now exclusively in regime II.

Almost all spheres that you drop in air operate exclusively in regime two.

Whether it is a raindrop or whether it is a baseball that you hit, or a golf ball, or even a beach ball, or you throw a pebble off a high building, or whether you jump out of an airplane, with or without a parachute, makes no difference, you're always dominated by the pressure term, by the v^2 term, and you always are in a range whereby the terminal speed is proportional to the square root of the radius for a given density of the object.

If you take a pebble with a radius of about 1 cm and you throw it off a high building, it will reach a speed which will not exceed 75 mi/hr because of the air drag.

If you jump out of a plane and you have no parachute and I make the assumption that your mass is about 70 kg--

If I can approximate you by a sphere with a radius of about 40 cm--
then the terminal velocity is 150 mi/hr.

I just read an article yesterday about sky divers who jump out of planes, and they want to open the parachute at the very last possible, and they reach terminal velocities of 120 mi/hr, which doesn't surprise me.

Of course, then they open the parachute and then the air drag increases enormously and then they slow down even further.

I told you almost all raindrops operate in regime II when they fall.

So the terminal velocity is dictated by the v^2 term.

However, if you make the drops exceedingly small, there comes a time that you really enter regime I.

I have here a ball--weighs approximately 34 g.

and the radius is about 35 cm.

It's about 70 centimeters across.

I can calculate what the terminal velocity is--and so I find that to be about 1.8 m/s.

So if I drop it from a height of 3 m, then you would think that the time that it takes to hit the floor would be about 1.7 s.

However, it will, of course, take longer, and the reason is that the terminal velocity is not achieved instantaneously.

Now, if you want to calculate the time that it takes to get close to terminal speed, that is not an easy task, because you are going to end up with a nasty differential equation.

You see, we have 

![\dot v + \frac{C_1 r v}{m} + \frac{C_2 r^2}{m} v^2 = g ](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdot%20v%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7BC_1%20r%20v%7D%7Bm%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cfrac%7BC_2%20r%5E2%7D%7Bm%7D%20v%5E2%20%3D%20g)

and this cannot be solved analytically.

But I've asked my graduate student Dave Pooley to solve this for me numerically.

![Falling Balloon with and without Air Drag][3]

So let's try this.

And we're going to throw this object, and you may get something that is larger than 1.8 seconds, and the reasons are the following.

1. this is not a perfect sphere
2. this balloon is very springy, and creates turbulence.

Turbulence is extremely hard to understand and predict.

The prediction was 1.8; you get 2.0.

## Numerical Calculations of Air Drag Examples

Throw a pebble off the Empire State Building.

* radius of 1 cm
* with air drag, the terminal speed would be about 75 mi/hr
* without air drag, the speed would reach 225 mi/hr

Empire State Building has a height of 475 m. If there had been no air drag, it would hit the ground a little less than 10 s, but now it will hit the ground more like 16, 17 seconds.

And you see that the terminal speed builds up in about 5, 6 seconds.

Now, you may remember that we dropped an apple from 3 m and that we calculated the gravitational acceleration given the time that it takes to fall.

* the effect of air drag on the 3 m drop is only a delay of 2 ms

## Resistive Forces and Trajectories

__How does air drag influence trajectories?__ 

The motion of an object in liquid, giving an initial speed in the x direction

![Trajectory in a liquid][4]

If there were no drag, then the trajectory would be a parabola, and the horizontal velocity would always be the same.

Because of the drag force by the liquid, the object is going to get a  component of the resistive force in the vertical direction.

It has a horizontal speed, so there's also going to be a component of the resistive force in the x-direction.

And then ultimately, there would be no horizontal speed, and the object would go vertically down with the terminal speed that you can find from dropping an object just into the liquid vertically.

### Example:

Suppose I take a tennis ball and I throw up a tennis ball in 26.100.

In the absence of any air drag, I would get a nice parabola which will be completely symmetric.

But with air drag, there's going to be an air drag force in the y direction, there will also be a resistive force in the x direction. The trajectory would be asymmetric.

![Trajectory with and without air drag][5]

Clearly you don't reach the highest point that you would have reached without air drag.

__Demo: air drag effect on tennis ball and styrofoam ball__

* tennis ball and styrofoam ball has about the same radius, so the resistive force is the same on both
* styrofoam ball has way smaller mass than tennis ball, so air drag would have larger effect on styrofoam ball.

When this object goes from O to P, that takes a certain amount of time.

When it goes from P to S, back to the ground, that takes also a certain amount of time.

Is OP time the same as PS time? 

-OR-

Is OP time longer than OS time?

-OR- 

Is OP time shorter than OS time?
