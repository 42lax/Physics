## Fundamental Units

__In physics, we explore the very small to the very large.__

The very small is a small fraction of a proton and the very large is the universe itself.

They span 45 orders of magnitude--a 1 with 45 zeroes.

__To express measurements quantitatively, we have to introduce units.__

* the unit of __length__: the __meter__, m
* the unit of __time__: the __second__, s
* the unit of __mass__: the __kilogram__, kg.

> TODO: add reference to definition and evolution of these units

Many __derived units__ are defined for conveience, and some are tailored toward specific fields.

* centimeters, millimeters, kilometers
* inches, feet, miles
* astronomical unit (mean distance between the earth and the sun)
* light-year (the distance that light travels in one year)
* milliseconds, microseconds, days, weeks, hours, centuries, months
* milligrams, pounds, metric tons

## Discussion of Powers of Ten

__Movie__: [The Power of 10][1]

* covers 40 orders of magnitude
* originally conceived by a Dutchman named Kees Boeke in the early '50s
* second-generation movie, voice over by Professor Morrison, a MIT professor 

## Dimensions

__Three fundamental quantities in physics__: 

* length: symbol L
* time: symbol T
* mass: symbol M

__All other quantities in physics can be derived from these fundamental quantities.__

__Notation for dimension__: bracket

### Examples:

[speed]: means the dimension of speed

* \\( [ \text{speed} ] = {[\text{L}] \over [\text{T}]} \\)
* \\( [ \text{volume} ] = [ \text{L} ]^3 \\)
* \\( [ \text{density} ] = {[\text{M}] \over [\text{L}]^3} \\)
* \\( [ \text{acceleration} ] = {[\text{L}] \over [\text{T}]^2} \\)

## The Art of Making Measurements

__Any measurement that you make without any knowledge of the uncertainty is meaningless.__

### Demo: Someone who is lying in bed is longer than someone who stands up?

Have a setup to measure something horizontally and vertically

1. Aluminum bar (calibration):

	vertical:   \\( 150.0 \pm 0.1\ cm \\)<br>
	horizontal: \\( 149.9 \pm 0.1\ cm \\) 

2. Student 

	stand up:   \\( 183.2 \pm 0.1\ cm \\)<br>
	lie down: 	\\( 185.7 \pm 0.1\ cm \\)

## Was Galileo Galilei's Reasoning Correct?

Galileo Galilei: __Why are mammals as large as they are and not much larger?__ 

He argued that if the mammal becomes too massive that the bones will break and he thought that that was a limiting factor. 

Model of a Mammal:

* has a size, \\( S \\) (大約是身長)
* has a mass, \\( m \\)
* has a thigh bone, called the __femur (大腿骨)__
* the femur carries the body, to a large extent
	* has a length, \\( l \\) 
	* has a thickness, \\( d \\)
	* has a cross-sectional area, \\( A \\)

![Sketch of animal and femur][2]

A __scaling argument__:

1. If an animal is 4 times larger than another, you would need 4 times longer legs

	\\( l \propto S \\)

2. The mass of an animal is proportional to the third power of the size because that's related to its volume

	\\( m \propto S^3 \\)

3. From 1 and 2, the mass of an animal must also be proportional to the third power of the length of the femur

	\\( m \propto l^3 \\)

4. Pressure on the femur is proportional to the weight of the animal divided by the cross-section \\( A \\) of the femur

	\\( P \propto {m \over d^2} \\)

5. If the pressure is higher than a certain level, the bones will break. Therefore, for an animal not to break its bones when the mass goes up by a certain factor, say a factor of four, \\( d^2 \\) must also go up by a factor of 4

	\\( m \uparrow 4 \Rightarrow d^2 \uparrow 4 \\) 

6. Therefore, the mass must be proportional to \\( d^2 \\).

	\\( m \propto d^2 \\)

7. Compare 3 and 6

	\\( m \propto l^3 \wedge m \propto d^2 \\)

8. \\( \therefore d \propto l^{3/2} \\)

__What is this result telling you?__

* If animal 1 is 10 times larger than animal 2, then the lengths of the legs are 10 times larger, but the thickness of the femur is 31.6 times larger (\\( 10^{1.5} \\))

__Comparing the femurs of various animals:__

* mouse (鼠)
* oppossum (負鼠)
* raccoon (浣熊)
* antelope (羚羊)
* horse (馬)
* moose (麋鹿)
* elephant (象)

![Femur of animals][3]

There is no evidence whatsoever that \\( d \over l \\) is really larger for the elephant than for the mouse.

These vertical bars indicate my uncertainty in measurements of thickness and the horizontal scale, is in logarithmic scale...

The \\( d \over l \\) for the mouse is really not all that different from the elephant

## Dimensional Analysis

__If I drop an apple from a certain height and I change that height, what will happen with the time for the apple to fall?__

Drop the apple from a height, \\( h \\):

1. If the height is larger, it takes longer for the apple to fall
2. If something is more massive, it will probably take less time
3. If gravity is stronger, it will take less time to fall

$$ t \propto h^\alpha m^\beta g^\gamma $$

__The dimensions on the left and right hand side of the equation must be the same.__

What is the dimension here?

$$ [T]^1 = [L]^\alpha [M]^\beta {[L]^\gamma \over [T]^{2 \gamma}} $$

LHS = RHS:

* [M]: \\( \beta = 0 \\)
* [L]: \\( \alpha + \gamma = 0 \\)
* [T]: \\( 1 = -2 \gamma \\)

Solve:

* \\( \gamma = -1/2 \\)
* \\( \alpha = +1/2 \\)

Conclusion:

* \\( t = C \sqrt{h \over g} \propto \sqrt{h} \\)
* Cannot predict the time to fall, but can compare two different heights
* e.g. drop from 8 m takes twice as long as drop from 2 m

### Demo: drop an apple from 2 different heights

Setup:

* \\( h_1 = 3.000 \pm 0.003\ m \\) 
* \\( h_2 = 1.500 \pm 0.003\ m \\)

Prediction:

* \\( {h_1 \over h_2} = 2.000 \pm 0.006 \\)
* \\( {t_1 \over t_2} = \sqrt{h_1 \over h_2} = 1.414 \pm 0.002 \\)

Observation:

* \\( t_1 = 0.781 \pm 0.002\ s \\)
* \\( t_2 = 0.551 \pm 0.002\ s \\)
* \\( {t_1 \over t_2} = 1.417 \pm 0.008 \\)

We have demonstrated that the time that it takes for an object to fall is independent of its mass.

__Is this dimensional analysis perhaps not quite kosher?__

Maybe.

__Is this dimensional analysis perhaps one that could have been done differently?__

1. the higher it is, the more it will take
2. the heavier it is, probably the less it will take
3. increase the mass of the Earth, the apple will fall faster

--> DEAD END

__Is there something wrong with the analysis that we did?__

__Is ours perhaps better than this one?__

Well, it's a different one.

We came to the conclusion that the time that it takes for the apple to fall is independent of the mass.

__Do we believe that?__

Yes, we do.

On the other hand, there are very prestigious physicists who even nowadays do very fancy experiments and they try to demonstrate that the time for an apple to fall does depend on its mass even though it probably is only very small, if it's true but they try to prove that. 

So we do believe that it's independent of the mass. 

However, this was not a proof because if you do it this way, you get stuck.
