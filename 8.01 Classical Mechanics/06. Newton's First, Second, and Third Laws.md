## Newton's First Law and Inertial Reference Frames

* The first law goes back to the first part of the 17th century

	Galileo expressed what he called __the law of inertia__:

	> A body at rest remains at rest and a body in motion continues to move at constant velocity along a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.

	Newton's own words in his famous book, Principia:

	> Every body perseveres in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a right line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.

Newton's First Law is clearly against our daily experiences:

* Things that move don't move along a straight line
* Things don't continue to move
* the reason is
	* there's gravity.
	* there is friction (e.g. air drag)

__Newtons' first law does not hold in all reference frames.__

* For instance, doesn't hold in a reference frame which itself is being accelerated

### Example: 

Imagine that Professor Lewin is accelerating towards the audience 

Stationary observer:

* Professor's velocity is changing so there must be a force on him
* Professor does feel the push

Professor Lewin:

* The audience is accelerating towards him
* However, the audience does not feel the push or pull

__When does the First Law work?__ 

"__inertial__" frame of reference: a frame in which there are no accelerations of any kind.

__Is 26.100, this lecture hall, an inertial reference frame?__

1. the earth rotates about its own axis
2. the earth goes around the sun.
3. the sun goes around the Milky Way

So clearly 26.100 is not an inertial reference frame.

Estimate the effect of these accelerations:

Due to the earth's rotation:

![Acceleration due to earth's rotation][1]

* rotating with angular velocity: ![\omega](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega)
* the earth has a certain radius: ![R_{\bigoplus}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7D)

Period of rotation, ![T = 24 \times 3600 s](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T%20%3D%2024%20%5Ctimes%203600%20%5C%3B%20s)

So, 

![\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \frac{2\pi}{24 \times 3600} rad/s](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Comega%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7BT%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B24%20%5Ctimes%203600%7D%20%5C%3B%20rad/s)

Hence, the centripetal acceleration at the equator is, 

![a_c = \omega^2 R_{\bigoplus} = \left(\frac{2\pi}{24 \times 3600}\right)^2 \cdot 6.4 \times 10^6 = 0.034 m/s^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a_c%20%3D%20%5Comega%5E2%20R_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7D%20%3D%20%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B24%20%5Ctimes%203600%7D%5Cright%29%5E2%20%5Ccdot%206.4%20%5Ctimes%2010%5E6%20%3D%200.034%20%5C%3B%20m/s%5E2)

This is 300 times smaller than the gravitational acceleration that you experience here on Earth.

The motion of the earth around the sun is an additional factor of 5 times lower.

In other words, these accelerations even though they're real and they can be measured easily with today's high-tech instrumentation--

they are much, much lower than what we are used to which is the gravitational acceleration.

And therefore, in spite of these accelerations, we will accept this hall as a reasonably good inertial frame of reference in which the First Law then should hold.

__Can Newton's Law be proven?__ 

* The answer is no, because it's impossible to be sure that your reference frame is without any accelerations.

__Do we believe in this?__

Yes, we do.

We believe in it since it is consistent within the uncertainty of the measurements with all experiments that have been done.

## Newton's Second Law

![An spring that is extended][2]

I have a spring...

* somewhere in outer space, no gravity
* I extend the spring over a certain distance
* experimental fact: ![m_1 a_1 = m_2 a_2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1%20a_1%20%3D%20m_2%20a_2)

__Definition of force__: ma

__The Second Law__:

> A force action on a body gives it an __acceleration which is in the direction of the force__ and has __a magnitude given by ma__.

![\vec{F} = m\vec{a}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%3D%20m%5Cvec%7Ba%7D)

The unit of this force is ![kg \cdot m/s^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?kg%20%5Ccdot%20m/s%5E2), or "newton", N.

__The Second Law only holds in inertial reference frames.__

__Can the Second Law be proven?__

No.

__Do we believe in it?__ 

Yes.

__Why do we believe in it?__

Because all experiments and all measurements within the uncertainty of the measurements are in agreement with the Second Law.

__How can you ever determine a mass if there is no force somewhere?__

* If the mass were determined by a scale, you were making use of gravitational force.
* Is this some kind of a circular argument that you're using? The answer is NO.
* Mass is determined by the number of molecules (e.g. cheese in outer space, twice the cheese, twice the mass) so don't need gravity to have relative scales of masses

## Superposition of Forces and Net Force

Since all objects in this lecture hall and the earth fall with the constant acceleration, which is g, we can write down that 

![F_g = m g](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_g%20%3D%20m%20g)

Suppose I have here this softball in my hands.

![Softball in hand][3]

In the reference frame of 26.100...an inertial reference frame

* the force on the softball must be zero.

	![F_{WL} + m g = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_%7BWL%7D%20&plus;%20m%20g%20%3D%200)

* Notice that there is no statement made on velocity or speed.

If we take gravity and an object was falling down with 5 m/s, that the law would hold; as it would with falling speed of 5,000 m/s

__Will it always hold?__

No.

Once your speed approaches the speed of light then Newtonian mechanics no longer works. Then you have to use _Einstein's theory of special relativity_.

So this is only valid as long as we have speeds that are substantially smaller, say, than the speed of light.

## Newton's Third Law, Action = -Reaction

Newton's Third Law: 

> If one object exerts a force on another, the other exerts the same force in opposite direction on the one.

OR simply, "Action = - Reaction"

e.g. Sit on your seats. 

* You are pulled down on your seats because of gravity 
* the seats will push back on you with the same force.

e.g. I held the baseball in my hand.

* The baseball pushes on my hand with a certain force.
* I push on the baseball with the same force.

e.g. I push against the wall

* I push against the wall with a certain force.
* the wall pushes back on me with exactly the same force.

__The Third Law always holds.__

* Whether the objects are moving or accelerated makes no difference.

### Simple example:

![2 masses being pushed][4].

* m1 = 5 kg
* m2 = 15 kg
* F = 20 N

__What is the acceleration of this system?__ 

![\vec{F} = m\vec{a}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%3D%20m%5Cvec%7Ba%7D)

![\vec{F} = (m_1 + m_2)\vec{a}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20%3D%20%28m_1%20&plus;%20m_2%29%5Cvec%7Ba%7D)

![\vec{a} = 1 \hat{F}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20%3D%201%20%5C%3B%20%5Chat%7BF%7D) m/s^2

![Force diagram of object number 2][5]

Let the force, F_12, be the force that one exerts on two.

![\vec{F}_{12} = m_2 \cdot \vec{a} = 15 \hat{F}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7B12%7D%20%3D%20m_2%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20%3D%2015%20%5C%3B%20%5Chat%7BF%7D)

![Force diagram of object number 1][6]

![\vec{F} + \vec{F}_{21} = m_1 \vec{a} = 5 \hat{F}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D%20&plus;%20%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7B21%7D%20%3D%20m_1%20%5Cvec%7Ba%7D%20%3D%205%20%5C%3B%20%5Chat%7BF%7D)

![\vec{F}_{21} = -15 \hat{F} = -\vec{F}_{12}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7B21%7D%20%3D%20-15%20%5Chat%7BF%7D%20%3D%20-%5Cvec%7BF%7D_%7B12%7D)

In these two examples--

1. the baseball on my hand--consistent with the Third Law.
2. pushing on two masses--consistent with the Third Law.

Is this a proof? 

No.

__Can the Third Law be proven?__ 

No.

__Do we believe in it?__ 

Yes.

__Why do we believe in it?__

Because all measurements, all experiments within the uncertainties are consistent with the Third Law.

### Examples:

* garden hose snake backwards when faucet is turned on
* balloon flies backward when air is rushed out--basic idea behind the rocket
* If you fire a gun, the gun exerts a force on the bullet the bullet exerts an equal force on the gun which is called the _recoil_.
* walking, the floor is pushing back on you

### Demo: hero's engine

![Hero's Engine][7]

* a reservoir of water, which we will heat up.
* the steam will squirt out these hollow tubes

### Demo: hero's engine made from a Soda Can

* pop four holes in the soda can at the bottom
* when you put a nail in there, you bend every time the nail to the same side so the holes are slanted.
* put it in water and lift it out of water and you have a Hero's engine.

## Consequences of Newton's Third Law

Some bizarre consequences of these laws:

* Imagine that an object is falling towards the earth
* the object is 0.5 kg
* the earth exerts a force, mg = 5 N, on the object
* the object would also exert an equal but opposite force on earth

### Example:

Drop an apple from h = 100 m.

__How long would it hit the earth?__

* ![h = \frac{1}{2} g t^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?h%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20g%20t%5E2)
* ![t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \approx 4 s](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?t%20%3D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B2h%7D%7Bg%7D%7D%20%5Capprox%204%20s)

So after 4 seconds, it hits the earth--

But now, according to the Third Law, the earth must enxperience exactly the same force as the apple does but in opposite direction.

__What is the earth going to do?__

Well, the earth is going to fall towards the apple--

![5\mathrm{N} = F = M_{\bigoplus}a = (6 \cdot 10^{24})a](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?5%5Cmathrm%7BN%7D%20%3D%20F%20%3D%20M_%7B%5Cbigoplus%7Da%20%3D%20%286%20%5Ccdot%2010%5E%7B24%7D%29a)

![\therefore a \approx 8 \cdot 10^{-25} m/s^2](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctherefore%20a%20%5Capprox%208%20%5Ccdot%2010%5E%7B-25%7D%20m/s%5E2)

__How long will the earth fall?__

Well, the earth will fall roughly 4 seconds before they collide.

__How far does the earth move in the 4 seconds?__

![d = \frac{1}{2} a t^2 = 0.5 \times 8 \cdot 10^{-25} \times 20 = 8 \cdot 10^{-24} m](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?d%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%20a%20t%5E2%20%3D%200.5%20%5Ctimes%208%20%5Ccdot%2010%5E%7B-25%7D%20%5Ctimes%2020%20%3D%208%20%5Ccdot%2010%5E%7B-24%7D%20m)

## Decomposing Forces in x and y Directions

![An object hanged by two strings][8]

This object is hanging there, it's not being accelerated, so the net acceleration must be zero.

__How large is T1 and how large is T2?__

* ![\sum F_x = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum%20F_x%20%3D%200)  because there's no acceleration in the x direction
* ![\sum F_y = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum%20F_y%20%3D%200)

x: ![T_1 \cos 60^\circ - T_2 \cos 45^\circ = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_1%20%5Ccos%2060%5E%5Ccirc%20-%20T_2%20%5Ccos%2045%5E%5Ccirc%20%3D%200)

y: ![T_1 \sin 60^\circ + T_2 \sin 45^\circ - mg = 0](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_1%20%5Csin%2060%5E%5Ccirc%20&plus;%20T_2%20%5Csin%2045%5E%5Ccirc%20-%20mg%20%3D%200)

![T_1 = \frac{2 m g }{1 + \sqrt 3}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_1%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B2%20m%20g%20%7D%7B1%20&plus;%20%5Csqrt%203%7D) 

![T_2 = \frac{T_1}{\sqrt 2}](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_2%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BT_1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%202%7D)

Suppose we take a mass of 4 kg--

* m = 4 kg
* mg = 40 N for simplicity
* T_1 = 29.3 N
* T_2 = 20.7 N

### Another way to solve the tensions without decomposition

![Another way to solve the tensions][9]

* If the two tension forces must cancel out mg, why don't I flip mg over? 
* T1 and T2 now, together, must add up to the flipped over mg.

__How do we measure tension?__

* Use scales and tension meters 
* The scales are not very accurate

![Which string would break first?][10]

__Which of the strings will break first?__

1. pull down very fast --> the bottom one will break first
2. pull down slowly --> the top one will break first
