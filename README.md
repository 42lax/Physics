Physics is a very fascinating subject. 

Prof. Walter Lewin, the renowned professor emeritus at MIT, will make you love physics, and see the world in a different way.

As I watch his lecture videos on iTunes U, I would like to take down some notes so I won't forget easily and it won't be a waste of time. 

Please visit [MIT OpenCourseWare][1] to search for these three courses complete with homeworks, exams, etc.
